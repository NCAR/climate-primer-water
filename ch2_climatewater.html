<h2>2.1 Water-Availability Assessments<a class="headerlink" href="#water-availability-assessments" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Understanding which climate elements are important to water availability
assessments help us focus our efforts when performing climate-change
impact studies. Climate changes, particularly changes in temperature and
precipitation, have a direct impact on two key elements of the
hydrologic cycle: evaporation and precipitation. Other elements of the
hydrologic cycle—snowmelt, runoff, streamflow, and storage—are
consequently influenced. It is also important to understand other,
non-climate-related attributes of climate change scenarios (e.g.
socio-economic projections, land-use change assumptions, etc.) that will
affect water availability. While this climate primer will only cover
attributes and the use of the climate-change scenarios, it is also
important to mention that projected changes in elements outside climate
change scenarios, such as changes in water management systems (e.g.
diversions, storage, demand side management) will also impact future
water availability. These are often evaluated in Integrated Assessment
Models.</p>

<h3>2.2.1 Define the problem/objective<a class="headerlink" href="#define-the-problem-objective" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When any scientific research is tasked to consider climate change, the
starting point is to ask: what is the central aim of the study?
For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How often might water temperatures in streams be too dangerous for
aquatic life in the 2050-2080 period?</p></li>
<li><p>Why might we fail to reach water-delivery targets in the 2070-2100 period?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the chances of dropping below reservoir low-pool levels for
more than one consecutive year in the 2040-2070 period?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these questions examines the impacts of a future climate on
a system performance measure. Below are example measures for these questions.
Water managers, scientific experts (e.g., aquatic biologists), and
stakeholders are all good resources for defining these performance measures.
The problem and performance measures should be defined early in the study to
inform selection of the datasets and models that are optimal (in terms of resolutions,
accuracies, uncertainties) for the problem and target metrics.</p>

<h3>2.2.2 What is relevant, reliable, and practical?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-relevant-reliable-and-practical" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once you’ve defined your research questions and objectives, there are three
primary questions to answer when scoping a study that involves
integrating climate-change information:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What is relevant?</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Identify which climate impacts and climate-derived data are
important. The answer will likely vary depending on the research topic
and specific decisions that need to be made.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What is reliable?</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>There are varying degrees of confidence in projected climate and
climate-derived data. You must consider which set of climate
projection data to rely on and which potential climate futures to

</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What is practical?</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>The realities of the project, such as the availability of
resources, time, and personnel.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to these questions are closely related to the specifics of the
project goals, location, and stakeholder needs, and can vary from project to
project. You will need to balance the relevancy of the data and its
reliability with the practicality of implementation.</p>

<p class="sd-card-text">The “<strong>what is reliable”</strong> question recognizes there are varying degrees of confidence in projected climate and climate-derived data. To understand what is reliable, you should consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Balance reliability with relevancy</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Consider time horizons for the study</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Use historical observations to help determine reliability</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="sd-card-text">You should consider which set of climate projection data to rely on and which potential climate futures to consider. Issues of reliability and uncertainty, and how they depend on time-horizon, spatial-scale, and means or extremes of a climate variable, are also discussed in <a class="reference external" href="https://ncar.github.io/climate-primer-water/baselines.html">Chapter 3</a> of this primer.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Given the inherent uncertainty in climate projections when considering climate futures, you may need to strike a balance between using climate data that are relevant and using data that are reliable enough for the purpose of your project. For example, highly uncertain data may be fine for a project exploring system vulnerabilities to potential climate-change scenarios, but may be far too unreliable to underpin an infrastructure investment.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Balancing Reliability With Relevancy</p>
<p class="sd-card-text"><a class="reference internal" href="_images/image3.png"><img alt="image1" src="_images/image3.png" style="width: 6.5in; height: 3.30556in;" /></a></p>
<p class="sd-card-text">How do you determine which data are reliable enough to be trusted to answer the questions posed by the project? The challenge here is to determine how reliable the data need to be to consider it “reliable enough” for inclusion as potential future climate data.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">On a relative scale of reliability, average long-term temperature trends are the most reliable. In addition, many projects require future temperature-derived information, such as frequency of heat waves, seasonal snow, and potential evaporation. These are less reliable but still considered relatively reliable at representing potential future climate. The slightly lower rating is due to the need for more time- and space-specific information, and the influence of less reliably projected phenomena such as precipitation, wind, and cloudiness.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Precipitation projections are more uncertain, but may still be reasonably reliable on larger regional scales and for long-term averages. Depending on your research questions, objectives such as long-term planning, reservoir operations, and adaptive management may still benefit from precipitation data that are only moderately reliable for describing potential future climates.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">For specific short-duration, local-area precipitation and precipitation-derived variables, precipitation-projection reliability is much lower. Yet these data are highly relevant to research questions related to extreme precipitation and runoff thresholds. Since extremes, by definition, occur rarely, you need to represent low-probability, high-consequence events in a future climate scenario.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Other approaches may help extract the most reliable possible information about local extremes, such as those related to the study time period and/or the use of historical observations.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">A study’s time horizon may help minimize some of the reliability issues when dealing with highly uncertain climate variables. Consider the cone below, where the lines and colored circles represent the hypothetical futures for five climate projections. The left side represents the current time, the right side 2100.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text"><a class="reference internal" href="_images/image5.png"><img alt="image2" src="_images/image5.png" style="width: 4.27083in; height: 2.95833in;" /></a></p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Historical observations may be used to increase our confidence in using variables with high uncertainty by providing context about the range of future conditions. This issue is also discussed in <a class="reference external" href="https://ncar.github.io/climate-primer-water/baselines.html">Chapter 3</a> of this primer. Historical observations fall into two categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Those from the period of instrumentation, which contains directly measured amounts and timing as well as trends</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Paleo observations from ice cores, tree rings, alluvial deposits, or other proxy data, which provide estimates from before the period of instrumentation</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="sd-card-text">The historical record of temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and other variables can be merged with projected trends to provide an estimate of the time sequencing of events, such as drought and flood, in potential future climates. Although the past is not a perfect predictor of the future sequencing of climate events, it may be the most reliable guidance for informing research questions that need that kind of information. An example of how this sequencing is carried out is provided in <a class="reference external" href="https://ncar.github.io/climate-primer-water/downscaling.html">Chapter 5</a>. This can be very important for objectives such as reservoir operations, long-term planning, and species recovery, where the regularity and frequency of events, like severe drought, are relevant and need the most reliable guidance.</p>

<p class="sd-card-text">The “<strong>what is practical</strong>” question is related to the realities of the project, such as the availability of resources, time, and personnel.
Questions to consider include the following.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Do you have the necessary resources and modeling capabilities?</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">How might climate change affect your modeling approach?</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Which climate-change influences can be represented practically?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="sd-card-text">Is it practical to expect that your study will sufficiently model system metrics? You may need to consider the following questions to answer that.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Are the models needed to incorporate climate change readily available?</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">How easy are they to run and how long do they take to run?</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">What are the implications of having to link multiple models, for example, a hydrological model that produces water temperature with a reservoir operations model?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="sd-card-text">The answers may determine whether the project has a good chance of successful completion.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Climate change itself may influence the choices you make for modeling and analyzing data for your study. For example, water temperature in a stream that has been historically controlled by groundwater input may need to be controlled by reservoir releases in the future. Such a study may require detailed information about the time evolution of variables as the climate changes. Model issues may pose constraints, making some approaches impractical given your project resources.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Is it practical to consider multiple futures given the following?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Resources and personnel available</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Desire for project partners to explore the range of possibilities</p></li>
<li><p class="sd-card-text">Complexity and particular requirements for modeling the relevant influences</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="sd-card-text">In some cases, using a small set of climate-change scenarios (such as a wet scenario and a dry scenario for long-term planning for water availability) may be the most practical approach for balancing multiple futures with limited resources. In this way, the study can explore a range of potential future climates with relatively low impacts on its resources. <a class="reference external" href="https://ncar.github.io/climate-primer-water/downscaling.html">Chapter 5</a> of this primer will explore this issue further by providing an example of how this process is carried out.</p>

<p><strong>Predictions vs. Projections</strong></p>
<p>Predictions and forecasts are probabilistic estimates of the future
based on current conditions, with the expectation that decisions made today
will have little impact on the estimates. Climate prediction refers to
the short-term evolution of a weather system from an initial state under
constant boundary conditions. The initial value is represented by the initial
states of the climate system, including ocean heat content, and surface snow and
ice cover. Predictions are associated with probability that can be verified.
For lead times of weeks to months, predictions are typically based on
both initial and boundary values. Climate predictions, such as seasonal
outlooks, El Niño forecasts, and seasonal hurricane outlooks, fall into
this category.</p>
<p>Projection refers to how the statistical measures associated with a
climate system will change in response to changing boundary values.
Climate projections are generally framed as “if-then” statements where
decisions made today and in the future are expected to impact estimates.
Projections, like predictions, may also be associated with
probabilities, but they often cannot be verified in time to provide
meaningful feedback to the climate modeling system.</p>

<p><strong>Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>Scenarios are projections of what potential futures may look like. They
require context and are generally used in pairs (e.g., with and without
mitigation) or ensembles (e.g., the IPCC SSSP-RCP scenarios). There
are several types of scenarios used in climate modeling, and
many are linked.</p>
<p><strong>“Climate-change scenario”</strong> describes a set of possible mean
characteristics of a future climate; for example, hotter and wetter.
Climate models are used to produce climate projections. Climate projections
inform or provide the detailed climate information needed for climate-change scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>“Emissions scenarios”</strong> represent realistic pathways of greenhouse
gas concentration effects on the likely emissions rates caused by changes in anthropogenic factors. The emissions scenarios are the
driving force, or cause; the climate-change scenarios capture the effect.
Emissions scenarios are used as boundary-value input for climate models.</p>
<p><strong>“Socioeconomic scenarios”</strong> represent societal drivers, including
impacts from demographic, economic, and technological factors.</p>
<p><strong>Narratives or Storylines</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2317-9">Shepherd et al. (2018)</a>
define storylines (or narratives) as “physically self-consistent unfolding
of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways.” Storylines
focus on understanding driving factors and impacts. They are useful
when orienting towards stakeholder decision-making and policy, which are
often driven by impactful events. Storylines are also useful for “bottom-up”
approaches where you want to work backward from a particular event and “stress test”
the system with compounding drivers (e.g., climate change and urbanization).</p>
<p>An example use of storylines for water-availability assessments is provided in
