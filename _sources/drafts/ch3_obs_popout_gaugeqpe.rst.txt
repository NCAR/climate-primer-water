**Rain Gauge QPE**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As long as humans have kept weather records there has been a need to
capture precipitation in some sort of collection device.

Today’s precipitation gauges, hereafter referred to as rain gauges, are
the current version of those collection devices.

|Automated tipping bucket gauge|

Rain gauges come in a variety of styles, both manual and automated...

|All weather precip accumulation gauge (AWPAG)|

and are used to measure rain as well as the liquid equivalent of frozen
precipitation.

|Rooftop optical recording gauge|

In this section we will discuss the reality of the term “ground truth”.
In doing so we will discuss the impact on gauge measurement, or “gauge
catch,” from wind, the physical characteristics and location of the
gauge, and the characteristics of the precipitation. We will offer some
perspective on these issues with respect to whether the gauge is
automated or manual.

**Rain Gauge QPE » Are they really ground truth?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often referred to as “ground truth”, rain gauges are subject to errors
from a variety of sources. Although gauges do often provide excellent
point measurements, at times the error in those measurements can become
quite large. Sources of error include the construction and exposure of
the gauge itself, the character of the precipitation, and the weather
conditions.

Even a perfectly accurate rain gauge network, if such a thing exists,
may not be representative of the areal variations in the precipitation
accumulation. Because they are point measurements, gauges are only
representative of the immediate vicinity where they are located.

**Rain Gauge QPE » Exercise: Gauges, Wind, and Fall Angle**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In still air the hydrometeors that make up precipitation fall vertically
downward to the gauge.

|Heavy rainfall falling vertically|

Wind causes precipitation to fall at an angle with respect to the
vertical. In addition, the gauge itself presents an obstacle to the
flow. This results in altered wind patterns near the gauge.

|Rainfall in hurricane falling at an angle|

The effects of the wind will vary depending on hydrometeor phase and
size.

-  No wind: precipitation falls vertically downward

-  Wind causes precipitation to fall at an angle

-  Wind causes altered wind patterns near gauge

-  Wind effects vary with hydrometeor phase and size

In this exercise we will consider typical 2 mm-diameter raindrop. We
will take the perspective of 2-mm drops falling toward the gauge
opening. Consider a 0° fall angle to be that of rain falling perfectly
vertical, and a 90° fall angle is rain blowing perpendicular to the
gauge.

Compare how the fall angle changes in the following figures, along with
the effective collection area of the gauge, as wind speed changes. For
each wind speed you can compare the ideal catch area of the gauge with
the effective catch area that is determined by the fall angle. When you
are ready, answer the questions provided.

**Rain Gauge QPE » Gauges, Wind, and Turbulence**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exercise that you just completed showed a simplified look at the
impact of wind on gauge catch. The fall angle considerations represent a
worst-case scenario. But in addition to fall angle considerations,
turbulence in the flow may influence the trajectory of hydrometeors.
This may partially offset errors caused by the wind. Spacing between
hydrometeors may also change due to wind effects, possibly offsetting
some of the wind-induced errors.

Here we see an increase in wind speed over the gauge, but we also see
turbulence- induced downward motion. Note from the trajectories that
this may increase catch, although sometimes the primary gauge-induced
downward motion may be downwind of the gauge.

Ground-induced turbulence in the vicinity of the gauge may be much more
important for improving gauge catch than turbulence induced by the gauge
itself.

|Effects of wind turbulence near the ground on precipitation and gauge
catch|

As long as the ground objects are not tall enough to intercept incoming
precipitation, the turbulence-induced downward motion has the effect of
turning the hydrometeors vertically toward the ground.

|Effects of wind turbulence near the ground on precipitation and gauge
catch - wind blockage by trees|

Elevated gauges are less likely to benefit from ground-induced
turbulence.

|Effects of wind turbulence near the ground on precipitation and gauge
catch - tree blockage and elevated gauge|

A clearing within the trees may provide the best balance between
reducing wind speed but not altering precipitation distribution too
much. Remember that the effects from deciduous trees are seasonal.

measure the weight of accumulated snow. Snow pillows will be discussed
in more detail later. )

**Rain Gauge QPE » Rain, Gauge Catch, and Wind**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In summary, gauge catch of rain is influenced by both the fall angle and
the turbulence in the vicinity of the gauge.

|Effects of wind turbulence near the ground on precipitation and gauge
catch - tree blockage and elevated gauge|

Fall angles that depart from the verical will result in a reduction of
the gauge's effective collection area. Turbulence partially offsets this
problem by inducing downward motion around the gauge.

This graphic shows the generalized relationship between wind speed and
gauge catch for liquid hydrometeors. The gauge catch is expressed as the
ratio of the gauge measurement to what actually fell, so values less
than 1.0 are measures of underestimation by the gauge.

|Relationship between wind speed and gauge measurement for liquid
hydrometeors|

For a typical size raindrop of 2-2.5 mm, a general rule of thumb is to
expect a 1% loss of precipitation for every 1 mph increment in wind
speed. This converts to 2.2% for every 1 m/s.

Therefore, a 9 m/s (20 mph) wind speed may be expected to result in an
underestimation factor of 0.80, or a 20% underestimation of the
rainfall.

There is a large envelope of uncertainty due to the variability in drop
sizes, the steadiness of the wind, and the gauge location. Here are a
few main points to remember. The best measurements in windy conditions
will be in situations with large raindrops, gauges near ground level,
and shielded gauges. The poorest measurements will be with small
raindrops and drizzle drops, and when gauges are directly exposed to the
wind.

**Rain Gauge QPE » Snow, Gauge Catch, and Wind**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As demonstrated in the exercise, snow is more severely impacted by wind.

|Photo of snow blowing around rain gauge|

This photograph shows the typical collection of snow in a rain gauge
with relatively light winds of 5 m/s (11 mph). The snow is drifted up on
one side illustrating that only a portion of the opening, on the
downwind side, was effectively collecting the snow.

|Photo of snow blown in gauge on side|

A 5 m/s (11 mph) wind will result in gauge undercatch for snowflakes on
the order of tens of percent. The studies plotted on this graph show
that at a wind speed of 7 m/s (15 mph) the gauge may be catching only
10-50% of what actually falls! Even in the two studies where the gauge
catch was improved through use of wind shields, the gauge catch at 7 m/s
is still 50% or less. The magnitude of the problem will vary with
snowflake characteristics. Denser crystals will have less gauge catch
errors than low density crystals.

Snow pillows are a technology used at SNOTEL sites in the western United
States. These weigh the snow on the ground to get a liquid equivalent.
Users in the NWS generally find that these data are superior to those
provided by automated gauges.

Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) site:

**Rain Gauge QPE » Effects from Gauge Characteristics**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A gauge aperture of at least 102 mm (4 in) in diameter is desirable.
These NOAA-approved clear plastic gauges have 4-inch diameter apertures.
Smaller openings will increase the likelihood of under catch.

|4 inch rain gauge|

The NWS cooperative climate station manual gauges have a 203 mm (8 inch)
aperture.

|8 inch rain gauge|

As mentioned earlier, gauge catch is sometimes improved when nearby
vegetation disrupts the wind. A good location may be a forest clearing
where the trees are not close enough to directly intercept the
precipitation.

|Elevated gauge in a forest clearing|

The reason to elevate gauges or place them on rooftops is often driven
by security concerns rather than science. This increases the likelihood
of wind-induced errors.

**Rain Gauge QPE » Measurements from Automated Gauges**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automated rain gauges are preferred by many professional users such as
the NWS. Automation allows for the assimilation of numerous reports from
remote regions.

A widely used type of automated gauge in the United States is the
tipping bucket style. These allow for high temporal resolution.

|Inner workings of a tipping bucket rain gauge|

Problems associated with automated gauge measurements are often a
function of precipitation rate and precipitation phase.

Precipitation phase refers to whether the hydrometeors are liquid,
liquid and below freezing—such as freezing rain—or frozen, such as hail
or snow.

Freezing and frozen precipitation present a difficult problem for gauge
measurement. This is particularly true for the popular automated tipping
bucket gauge. To obtain a liquid equivalent measurement, the gauge must
be heated to melt the frozen precipitation. This can and often does lead
to sublimation or evaporation of precipitation without measuring it,
resulting in underestimates. In addition, if the snowfall rate is very
great, the melting will not occur fast enough to prevent gauge overflow,
again leading to underestimation.

Precipitation rate can also impact the accuracy of the gauge
measurement. Although this varies with gauge design, the problem has
been primarily with the tipping bucket style gauge as described in the
rain gauge webcast referred to earlier.

The NWS is testing an automated “weighing” gauge known as the all
weather precipitation accumulation gauge (AWPAG). There is still some
heating of the rim to help direct snow into the gauge where a weight
will determine the liquid equivalent. However, the heated area is not
nearly as large as that in the tipping bucket gauges used by the NWS.
Therefore, the errors with evaporation and sublimation should be
reduced.

|All weather precip accumulation gauge (AWPAG)|

Initial testing showed disappointing results in snow, perhaps due mainly
to wind effects.

A new double wind shield version of the AWPAG gauge that is being
deployed may help reduce the problems with measuring snow.

|All weather precipitation accumulation gauge (AWPAG) with
double-structure wind shield|

As mentioned earlier, “snow pillow” estimates at SNOTEL sites are often
used instead of gauges where they are available.

**Rain Gauge QPE » Measurements from Manual Gauges**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manual gauge reports suffer from the lack of high temporal resolution.
This makes manual reports less suitable for software programs that need
fast access to high resolution gauge reports.

However, manual gauges are visited routinely and therefore problems that
affect gauge measurement may be identified more quickly. These problems
can include insect or bird nests, leakage, overflow, blockage from
rapidly growing vegetation, and vandalism.

|Rain gauge in snow|

Provided that gauge overflow does not occur during intense hail or
snowfall, manual gauges may allow more accurate liquid equivalent
measurements with frozen precipitation. Snow and hail are melted and
measured manually.

|Checking a rain gauge in snow conditions|

In addition, the observer may collect a “core” measurement of snow from
the ground if she/he determines that this will provide a more
representative sample than the snow that was collected by the gauge.
Core measurements are intended to minimize the errors caused by the
wind. A well trained observer may therefore provide improved liquid
equivalent readings.

|Taking a snow core sample|

There are numerous manual gauge networks. Two well-known ones are the
cooperative observing network and the Community Collaborative Rain,
Hail, and Snow observing network (CoCoRaHS).

The cooperative observing network, which is sponsored by NOAA’s National
Weather Service, has observers in every state. Roughly 80% of the
network still uses manual gauges.

|Map of coop rain gauge locations in the US|

The CoCoRaHS network is nationwide in the United States:

**Rain Gauge QPE » Rain Gauge QPE Key Points**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Rain gauges can provide excellent information if they are
   well-maintained, optimally located, and the wind is light.

-  Rain gauges are point estimates and will not necessarily provide good
   spatial resolution.

-  Wind causes significant errors in the gauge catch resulting in
   underestimation errors. These errors are greatest in strong wind, for
   exposed gauges, and for snowflakes and small liquid drops.

-  Wind-induced fall angles reduce the effective catch area of the
   gauge. Turbulence can induce downward motion that partially offsets
   the fall angle problem.

-  In situations where good radar coverage exists, it is possible that
   high wind situations may cause greater uncertainties in the accuracy
   of the gauges than that of the radar. A user of multiple
   precipitation sensors may want to consider the possibility that under
   such conditions it may not be wise to adjust the radar with the rain
   gauge data.
