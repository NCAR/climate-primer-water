Downscaling Method,Pros,Cons,Tools/Data Available?
Delta Change,Simple to implement; insightful in terms of sensitivity,Not physically consistent. Unrealistic physical change.,"Generally, method is simple enough to be directly used in a hydrologic model."
MACA- Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA),"Considers multiple climate variables simultaneously, ","Relies on quality of observational record. Needs a long obs record, more sophisticated due to multi-variate aspect. Assumes GCM spatial patterns contain necessary information.","A github R code is available, https://github.com/earthlab/cft"
LOCA- Locally Constructed Analogs,Simpler in terms of handling single variables,Similar to MACA.,https://loca.ucsd.edu/
Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD),Maintains the statistical properties of historical observations (also a con); available globally and represent daily sequences,"The spatially interpolated data can not represent spatial heterogeneity. Extremes are under-sampled, and wet-day frequency is poor.",https://ds.nccs.nasa.gov/thredds/catalog/AMES/NEX/GDDP-CMIP6/catalog.html
K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN),Simple and robust methods. Varying ways to implement to generate future climate projections,Relies on a high quality observational historical dataset (similar to MACA).,Both R and Python offer extensive KNN packages for generating downscaled data
En-GARD,"Employs multi-variate relationships to predict each variable, may be more robust in the future.","Assumes historical relationships persist, may underpredict changes in extreme precipitation.",Code available on github https://www.github.com/NCAR/gard
AI and Machine Learning,"Robust and efficient, powerful in finding relationships among variables. Computationally efficient","Assumes historical relationships will  hold into the future. Can be difficult to implement, and somewhat of a ‘black-box’. Very new and not well characterized.",Both R and Python offer extensive machine learning packages that can be used for developing downscaling datasets
Pseudo-Global Warming,Generally easier to implement as a dynamical downscaling approach. Based on a historic period so can be more societally relevant,"Can be physically inconsistent. Computationally expensive, large datasets that need post-processing, including bias-correction.",
Parametric Statistical Downscaling-https://www.sdsm.org.uk/software.html,Statistically rigorous. Autocorrelation and cross-correlations  between large-scale variables.,"More effort to implement, need to develop statistical relationships. Selection of predictors should be explored",https://www.sdsm.org.uk/sdsmmain.html; https://climate-scenarios.canada.ca/?page=pred-cmip6
