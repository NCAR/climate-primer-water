**Chapter 5 Key Takeaways**

Detection  is the identification of a significant change in the climate system (temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, shifts in seasonal cycles, etc.) that is above and beyond the natural internal variability of the system.

Climate attribution deals with determining the causes of detected changes in the climate. This involves assessing the various natural and anthropogenic (human-induced) factors that could have led to the observed changes.

Attribution of observed changes is not possible without some kind of model of the relationship between external climate drivers and observable variables, given that we cannot observe a world in which neither anthropogenic or natural forcing exist. 

  - Such models may be very simple (e.g., a set of statistical assumptions) or very complex (e.g., coupled Earth System Model)

A more recent approach in climate modeling for detection and attribution is to run a “Large Ensemble” of historical (and future) simulations, where each member of the ensemble is subject to natural+anthropogenic external forcings, but starts from a slightly different initial condition, which results in a different trajectory of internal variability once the memory of the initial state is lost.


The following observed and/or projected trends have an impact on planning for water and environmental resources:

  - Global average temperature has been warming and will continue to warm through the 21st century

  - Short-term natural cycles of increased warming interspersed with cooling (or slower warming) will be superimposed on the overall long-term warming

  - Average snow cover and snowpack in the United States are likely to decrease through the 21st century

  - Precipitation extremes (wet and dry) are likely to continue increasing through the 21st century, with some regional trends toward either more wet or more dry

  - These climate trends have, and will continue to have, impacts on water resources




5.1 Introduction
-------------------------------------------------

In this chapter we discuss the concept of the baseline natural variability  of a system under study, and ways to detect and potentially attribute the contribution of observed changes to natural and anthropogenic factors. Because climate change is a phenomenon that is typically characterized by slow changes through time, and that anthropogenic-induced climate change predominantly began in the mid-19th century (when atmospheric concentrations of CO2 began to show a marked increase correlating with industrial activities), significant changes may be detected through examination of the historical record, depending on the study area. At the same time, detection depends on how large the “natural variability” of the system of interest is. The Earth's climate systems exhibit natural variability due to a range of factors. These include variations in solar radiation (e.g., solar cycles), volcanic activity, ocean currents, atmospheric circulation patterns such as El Niño and La Niña, and geological processes like the shifting of tectonic plates (at time-scales of millions of years). Additionally, feedback mechanisms within the Earth's climate system can amplify or dampen these variations, leading to fluctuations in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other climatic parameters over different timescales, from years to centuries and beyond. The figure below from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/figures/figure-2-1) shows (on the left panel) the increase in the global surface temperature through time, while the panel at the right shows estimates of how much these temperature changes have been attributed to total human influence; solar and volcanic drivers; and internal climate variability. Although at the global scale, human impacts are the dominant contributor to these changes, natural variability generally becomes relatively a much larger contributor to observed changes as the spatial region of interest gets smaller, and as the timescales of interest also decrease.

We start with a brief overview of what these different types of variability are, where they have already been observed, then discuss methods that can be more generally applied to a particular region to discern these different types of variability. 

Here we provide introductory background information. 

The pop-out below discusses the distinction of weather and climate (i.e., differences in what are often termed “time scales of interest”).

.. dropdown:: **Weather vs Climate**

    Most of us know that climate and weather are not the same. It is sometimes said, "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."

    **Weather** describes the details of what we experience over the course of hours and days.

    |image_popoutweather1|

    **Climate** is the statistical representation of weather over days, months, seasons, years, decades, and longer

    |image_intro_popout_weather1|

    **A weather prediction, or forecast,** describes the near-term likelihood of a weather event such as a specific occurrence of rain or snow and/or the expected change in temperature. A weather forecast, for example, might read "colder with a 70% chance of snow this afternoon."

    **A climate prediction,** on the other hand, might call for below-average precipitation and near-average temperature over the next 30 days.`

    **Climate-model output:** used to generate statistics of weather phenomena`

      -Mean and variability of precipitation and temperature

      -Collective impact of weather events

    **Projections:** Lack specificity and predictability

    Climate models do predict specific weather events many years into the future, but not with the intention for use as time- and site-specific forecasts. Rather, the intended use of climate-model output is to generate statistics of weather phenomena, such as means and variability of precipitation or temperature, to characterize the collective impact of weather events. These climate predictions are typically referred to as projections or simulations and lack the short-term specificity of weather predictions.`

The pop-out below provides a description of the natural factors that influence our climate over time.

.. dropdown:: **Natural factors impacting climate variability**

    Earth's climate shifts over time because so many different land, ocean, and space phenomena have influence. The sun is the main driver of Earth's climate, as it provides most of the energy. The sun's energy output increased about a tenth of a percent from 1750 to 1950, which contributed about 0.2°F (0.1°C) warming in the first part of the 20th century. But since 1979, when we began taking measurements from space, the data show no long-term change in total solar energy, even though Earth has been warming.

    |Graphic showing Milankovitch cycles|

    Repetitive cycles in Earth's orbit can influence the angle and timing of sunlight. The tilt and wobble of Earth's axis and the degree to which its orbit is stretched produce the Milankovitch cycles, which scientists believe both triggered and rewarmed ice ages for the last few million years. But these changes take thousands of years, and so cannot explain the warming in this century.

    |Graphic showing continental drift|

    [Click to open a drifting continents & ocean currents animation.](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/broadcastmet/climate/media/video/continents_currents.mp4)

    Drifting continents make a big difference in climate over millions of years by changing ice caps at the poles and by steering ocean currents, which transport heat and cold throughout the ocean depths. In turn, these currents influence atmospheric processes. Snow and ice on Earth also affect climate because they reflect more solar energy than darker land cover or open water.

    |Global average surface temperature change with volcanic eruptions|

    Huge volcanic eruptions can cool Earth by injecting ash and tiny particles into the stratosphere. The resulting haze shades the sun for a year or two after each major blast. Dust and tiny particles thrown into the air by both natural processes and human activities can have a similar effect, although some absorb sunlight and help heat the climate.

    |Incoming solar radiation and the effect of increasing greenhouse gases|

    Greenhouse gases, which occur both naturally and as a result of human activities, also influence Earth's climate.

The pop-out below provides background information on the Earth’s energy balance, the factors that influence it, and thus lead to climate variability and change.

.. dropdown:: Earth’s energy balance and the greenhouse effect

    **Earth’s Energy Balance and the Greenhouse Effect**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    |still|

    The Earth is in a delicate equilibrium of solar energy (mainly shortwave
    ultraviolet) entering and longwave energy (mainly infrared) leaving.
    Slight alterations to this balance impact weather and climate. These can
    be caused by the natural cycles of climate variability, such as volcanic
    eruptions, that temporarily reduce the amount of solar energy reaching
    the Earth’s surface, thus disrupting the energy balance.

    |Volcanic eruption|

    Small changes to the balance of energy between the Sun and Earth are
    driving recent trends in global temperature.

    The diagram below of the energy cycle shows the amount of energy, in
    Watts per square meter, that enter the Earth-atmosphere-ocean
    system, remains within it, and leaves. Notice that about one third of the
    342 W/m2 of solar energy (the yellow arrows) is reflected back to space
    by the atmosphere or surface, while about two thirds are absorbed. As
    we’ve seen, the magnitude of solar energy reflected by aerosols
    sometimes increases temporarily after major volcanic eruptions, leading
    to temporary decreases in solar energy reaching Earth’s surface.

    On the right side of the diagram, the red arrows show the amount of
    terrestrial energy (mainly infrared) emitted by the Earth’s surface and
    atmosphere. Some is radiated back to space. But due to the presence of
    greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and water vapor in particular, a
    significant portion is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-radiated back
    to Earth. The “Back Radiation” portion of the diagram shows the heat
    energy radiated from the atmosphere to the surface. This is the
    **Greenhouse Effect**. Without naturally occurring greenhouse gases, the
    Earth would be an inhospitably cold and frozen planet.

    |The Earth-Sun Energy Balance|


The pop-out below provides introductory information on
natural climate variability versus anthropogenic climate change examples
for streamflow, CO2 emissions, and global temperature anomalies.

.. dropdown:: Introductory information

    **Natural Climate Variability versus Climate Change**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    |Ice core from Antarctica|

    Scientists have explored past global temperature trends using proxy
    data—tree rings, ice cores, etc.—that show the Earth has had numerous
    and somewhat irregular swings in temperature over the past several
    hundred thousand years. Those swings in temperature contribute to
    variations in other natural phenomena such as streamflow.

    |Map of Colorado River Basin.|

    For example, tree-ring analysis can be used to reconstruct
    streamflow in the rivers of the western United States. This has been
    done for rivers such as the Colorado River at Lee's Ferry, in the state
    of Arizona.

    |A reconstruction of streamflow for the Colorado River at Lees Ferry
    based on tree ring data.|

    The reconstructed streamflow shows large swings in annual streamflow
    volume on the Colorado River. Multi-year periods of wet and dry can be
    seen in the 25-year running mean of the annual streamflow.

    |Graph of temperatures and CO2 concentrations for the past 800,000
    years|

    Ice cores, on the other hand, can provide a depiction of changes in
    global temperature and CO\ :sub:`2` levels over the past several hundred
    thousand years. This graphic shows that warmer periods coincide with
    higher levels of CO\ :sub:`2`.

    Carbon dioxide levels have naturally fluctuated between 180 parts per
    million (ppm) and 280 ppm. This is an example of a naturally occurring
    climate forcing. Human industrialization has been a major source of the
    increase in CO\ :sub:`2` in the most recent century, with average annual
    concentrations exceeding 420 ppm in 2024. This is an example of
    anthropogenic forcing. We can see how carbon dioxide concentration has
    continued to rise over the last decade, as seen in the black line in the
    figure below.

    |Red line shows annual fluctuation in CO2 Concentration from 2012-2016.
    Black line shows the smoothed upward trend.|

    Trajectories of past global mean temperatures have been estimated using
    experiments conducted with Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models
    (AOGCMs). Experiments that do not incorporate anthropogenic forcing
    produce the trajectory shown with the blue line and the light blue
    uncertainty bounds in the figure below.

    The black line shows the observed global mean temperatures. You can see
    that the experiments that do not include anthropogenic forcings fail to
    reproduce the warming that has been observed over the past half century.

    Experiments were also run that do include anthropogenic forcings. This
    trajectory is shown with the red line and pink uncertainty bounds. You
    can see that when anthropogenic forcings are included, the global
    climate models do produce results that very closely match the observed
    warming trends. This suggests that anthropogenic factors have emerged as
    a significant contributor to global warming.

    |Models of 20th century climate run with and without anthropogenic
    greenhouse gases|


5.2 Climate variability
-------------------------------------------------

When accounting for climate-change impacts on research in water and
environmental studies, it is important to differentiate between climate
variability (for which the past can be a guide) and climate change,
where the past is not necessarily a good predictor as climate change
involves changes to this natural variability. Starting off this section,
we will review some of the natural climate cycles and occurrences.

.. dropdown:: Regular climate cycle

    **Regular Climate Cycle**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    |image1|

    The most regular climate cycle is the change of seasons. The seasons
    determine the times of year when precipitation may be most abundant,
    evapotranspiration will peak, tropical cyclones are most likely to form,
    and snowpack accumulates and melts. Although the change of seasons is
    very dependable, there is often year-to-year variation.

    |before|\ |after|

    To illustrate natural season-to-season variability, here we see
    differences in snowpack on the first of April in two consecutive years.
    The 2011 analysis shows large areas with above average snowpack in the
    central Rocky Mountain region and California Sierra Nevada Range in the
    United States. In 2012, these same areas had abnormally low snowpack,
    reflecting a less abundant snow season. Good research planning allows
    for such variation. But will the expected range of snowpack change as
    the climate warms?


When speaking of climate change, we are referring to changes in average
weather conditions that persist over multiple decades or longer. Climate
change encompasses both increases and decreases in temperature, as well
as shifts in precipitation, changes in frequency and location of severe
weather events, and changes to other features of the climate system.The
principal natural drivers of climate change (which are also termed
"external natural forcings"), include changes in incoming solar radiation
(through solar cycles), volcanic activity, orbital cycles, and
changes in global biogeochemical cycles.`

.. dropdown:: Irregular climate impacts

    **Irregular Climate Impacts**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    |Time series, observed, (1880-2000) of Global Temperature Change
    Relative to 1870-1899 Baseline with Five Major Volcanoes Indicated|

    Major volcanic eruptions are irregular natural climate events. In this
    global temperature time series, we can see how the sun-shielding
    properties of atmospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions result in
    decreased global average temperatures. Notice how Mt. Pinatubo’s 1991
    eruption decreased global average temperatures for 1-2 years.

.. dropdown:: Very long-term climate variability

    **Very Long-term Climate Variability**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    There are much longer climate variability cycles associated with changes
    in the Earth’s orbital eccentricity and its tilt with respect to the
    Sun.

    |Graphic showing Milankovitch cycles|

    These cycles, known as the Milankovitch Cycles, lead to big changes in
    the amount and distribution of solar energy on the Earth’s surface. The
    global temperature during these long-duration cycles ranges from being
    much colder (the ice ages) to much warmer than the current global
    average temperature.

    |Graph of temperatures and CO2 concentrations for the past 800,000
    years|

    Milankovitch Cycles unfold on timescales much longer than a human life
    span, from tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The rate of change
    associated with the Milankovitch Cycles is so slow that it will not
    impact water research planning for the next century or so.


Major anthropogenic drivers include atmospheric aerosols (fine
solid particles or liquid droplets), land-use change, and CO2 and
non-CO2 greenhouse gases. The natural and anthropogenic drivers taken
together make up what are called climate forcings.

.. dropdown:: Climate forcings

    **Climate Forcings**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    In this pop-out, we will examine how a number of forcings (both
    natural and anthropogenic) have influenced the energy balance between
    the Earth and Sun from 1880 to 2014, determining whether each forcing has had
    a warming effect (in which case the forcing goes above the zero change
    line) or a cooling effect (in which case the forcing goes below the zero
    change line).

    **Natural Factors**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Solar irradiance leads to some cyclic warming, but has a very small
    magnitude.

    |Exploring the Impact of Climate Forcings on Global Energy Balance|

    Volcanic eruptions have a notable cooling impact due to increased
    atmospheric albedo triggered by reflective volcanic aerosols. The
    cooling from volcanoes in the period examined was temporary, never
    lasting more than a few years. And, they had no real impact on the
    long-term trend.

    |image2|

     What effect does a typical large volcano have on carbon dioxide
    concentration compared to the effect from human activity? The diagram
    shows that in a typical year, the CO2 emissions from anthropogenic
    sources is 135 times greater than those from volcanoes, with some
    studies showing even greater differences. Even the 1991 eruption of Mt
    Pinatubo put roughly 1/500th of the 2010 emissions from anthropogenic
    activity into the atmosphere.

    |Comparison of the typical annual CO2 output from global volcanic
    activity versus human activity.|

    **Land Use**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Now we'll look at the Land-Use Forcings. What impact does land
    use have on the solar energy absorbed at the Earth’s surface?

    |image3|

    Land use leads to very small decreases in the energy absorbed at
    the surface, or small amounts of cooling. That’s because replacing
    forests with agricultural or urban land tends to increase the surface
    albedo and reflect more solar energy back to space.

    **Climate Forcings – What is Albedo?**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    |California/Nevada January Snowcover Comparison: 2013 versus 2014|

    Albedo is a measure of how well a surface can reflect solar energy.
    Reflective surfaces, like snow, ice, and clouds, have high albedo and
    are efficient at reflecting solar energy back to space. In the satellite
    images centered on the Sierra Nevada, snow and clouds have very high
    albedo and appear white. You can see that there may be large
    year-to-year differences in snow cover and thus the albedo. Even desert
    sands have high albedo and show up as relatively bright in this visible
    satellite imagery.

    Dark-colored surfaces have low albedo and absorb solar energy. This
    impacts the solar energy absorbed by Earth. Forest areas appear dark on
    visible satellite images, and are more efficient at absorbing solar
    energy. Bodies of water appear very dark and have very low albedos.

    **Anthropogenic Aerosols`**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Now we’ll look at the impact of Anthropogenic Aerosols (those
    resulting from human activity). What kind of impacts are related to
    anthropogenic aerosols?

    |image4|

    Anthropogenic aerosols have both warming and cooling impacts.
    That's because different aerosols have opposite effects on albedo. Dark
    particulates, such as black carbon, decrease albedo and increase
    absorption of solar energy, resulting in a warming effect. This occurs
    in the atmosphere as a whole, but also when black carbon settles out on
    otherwise reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice.`

    |image5|

    Other aerosols in the atmosphere are reflective and increase atmospheric albedo. This can occur from the aerosols themselves reflecting sunlight back to space, 
    or from aerosol enhancement of cloud development (an indirect effect). Cloud tops have high albedo and reflect solar energy back to space.


    What has the overall impact of anthropogenic aerosols been?

    |image6|

    The reflective anthropogenic aerosols dominate and thus the
    impact of all anthropogenic aerosols leads to climate cooling.

    **Greenhouse Gases**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Now we’ll look at the impact of Greenhouse Gases. All of the
    greenhouse gases result in a warming trend. Well mixed gases, such as
    carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, have the greatest impact,
    and this impact is increasing with time.

    |image7|

    The magnitude of the warming from greenhouse gas forcing is
    greater than the notable cooling effect from reflective aerosols.

    **All Forcings**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Now we’ll look at all forcings combined.

    |image8|

    When all variables are included in one time series, the trend
    induced by greenhouse gas forcing is clear. Net climate forcing has
    increased by 1 to 2 Watts per square meter since pre-industrial times,
    leading to the warming of the Earth by 1ºC (1.8ºF) through 2015. The
    warming effect induced by greenhouse gases has been tempered by the
    overall cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols, and occasional
    short-duration cooling from volcanic aerosols.

    **Climate Change and Climate Forcings**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    As we’ve seen, anthropogenic climate forcings result in a steady
    trend in global warming, with short-term variations caused by natural
    factors. Anthropogenic forcings have led to both global cooling (from
    reflective aerosols) and warming (from greenhouse gases) but the warming
    dominates over periods of multiple decades or longer.

    |Time series, observed and projected, (1880-2099) of Global Temperature
    Change Relative to 1870-1899 Baseline|

    By the middle part of the 21st century, even the cooling impact
    from notable volcanoes like Krakatau and Pinatubo won’t be able to
    temporarily cool the average global temperature to average 20th-century
    levels according to climate model projections.

    |Graph of temperatures and CO2 concentrations for the past 800,000
    years|

    When viewed in the context of Earth's average temperature over
    hundreds of thousands of years, the current warming is on par with some
    past epochs. But the increase in carbon dioxide, the most abundant
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas, is much greater than in past warm periods.
    This suggests that our very rapid warming--and it is very rapid on the
    geologic time scale--is just beginning. This greenhouse gas-induced
    warming is likely to dwarf the cooling factors as we move through the
    21st century.


The pop-out below discusses how the components of the energy cycle are
expected to change over the next few decades based on anthropogenic
changes to specific forcings.

.. dropdown:: Climate forcings impact on energy balance

    **Climate Forcings Impact on Energy Balance**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    In this pop-out we discuss how the components of the energy cycle are
    expected to change over the next few decades based on anthropogenic
    changes to specific forcings (discussed in previous pop-outs), while
    assuming continued emissions of greenhouse gases:

    |The Earth-Sun Energy Balance, annotated for an exercise|

    -  Incoming solar radiation (1) should stay the same over the time
       period of decades.

    -  Total reflected solar radiation from Earth (2 and 4) is uncertain.
       Increases in reflected solar energy are likely given that reflective
       aerosols and/or cloud cover continue to increase. But the uncertainty
       is because surface albedo should decrease with the continued loss of
       snow and ice.

    -  The amount of solar energy absorbed at the ground is uncertain. Of 
       the solar radiation that reaches the surface, a greater proportion is
       likely to be absorbed (3) due to the continued loss of snow and ice,
       but increases in reflective aerosols and clouds could reduce the
       amount of solar energy reaching the ground.

    -  As the global land and ocean surfaces (5) continue to warm on
       average, the radiative energy from the surface should continue to
       increase.

    -  Increasing greenhouse gases (6) will likely increase the amount of
       terrestrial radiation that is radiated back to the surface.

    -  The longwave radiation leaving the Earth (7) should decrease because
       more is being trapped by the atmosphere.

    -  It is important to note that the answers for all of the longwave
       fluxes could be different if rapid emissions reduction occurs.


In addition to these secular changes to the climate, there is
also variability that originates from natural processes within the
coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land-biosphere system that is
generally termed internally generated variability, arising primarily
from the uneven distribution of energy across the planet at any given
time (Lehner and Deser, 2023). A primary source of internal variability
is the atmospheric general circulation with its day-to-day and
week-to-week weather fluctuations with limits to their predictability
past a couple of weeks, and can be termed random or stochastic
processes past those limits. In general, the climate system is highly
variable at regional scales, and this internally-generated
variability is irregular in time and exhibits limited predictability.
Processes arising from the coupling between the ocean and atmosphere are
also important sources of internally generated variability that give
rise to distinctive patterns (or “modes”) of variability on interannual
and longer timescales (Deser and Phillips 2023). Examples include the
interannual events of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO); and the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO) patterns which can influence regional climate
conditions, such as droughts or cooling periods. It is a central
scientific challenge to identify anthropogenic influences on weather and
climate amidst this background of internal variability (Deser et al.
2020).

.. dropdown:: Semiregular climate cycles`

    **Semiregular Climate Cycles**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Recurring, but less regular, climate cycles often have a large influence
    on how the seasonal climate variations play out.

    A well known, semi-regular climate cycle is associated with the El Niño
    Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO can have a significant impact on
    precipitation and temperature in many regions of the world in a cycle
    that recurs roughly every 3-4 years.

    In the contiguous United States, the ENSO cycle can significantly
    influence precipitation distribution, especially in the cool season.

    Below we see the typical impacts of El Niño versus La Niña on both the
    sea-surface temperature anomalies of the tropical Pacific Ocean, and the
    November through March precipitation in the contiguous United States.
    The difference can be very important for snowpack and the potential for
    regional floods and drought. There are differences from one cycle to the
    next, but these composite maps provide guidance based on historic data.
    Note that La Niña typically results in a drier winter across a broader
    area than El Niño.

    |image9|

    |image10|

    Like ENSO, there are other natural atmospheric and oceanic cycles that
    have regional impacts on precipitation and temperature, including the
    Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), as seen below. And like ENSO, local
    research planning typically considers the range of variations that these
    cycles cause.

Natural climate variability can temporarily obscure or intensify
anthropogenic climate change on decadal time scales, especially in
regions with large internal interannual-to-decadal variability. Both the
rate of long-term change and the amplitude of interannual (year-to-year)
variability differ between global, regional and local scales, between
regions and across climate variables, thus influencing when changes
become apparent. As an example, tropical regions have experienced less
warming than most others, but also exhibit smaller interannual
variations in temperature. Accordingly, the signal of change is more
apparent in tropical regions than in regions with greater warming but
larger interannual variations (IPCC WG1).

The relative influence of natural and anthropogenic-induced
variability is also dependent on the spatial scale of the system being
examined. In general, the signs of climate change are unequivocal at the
global scale but are more difficult to discern on smaller spatial
scales. Discernible changes also depend on the climate variable. For
example, changes in average rainfall are becoming clear in some regions,
but not in others, mainly because natural year-to-year variations in
precipitation tend to be large relative to the magnitude of the
long-term trends.

The case study in the pop-out below of surface temperature
changes over time provides a visualization of natural variability and
its sensitivity to spatial and temporal scales, along with sensitivity
and detection of secular anomalies and trends.

.. dropdown:: Natural variability case study

    **Natural Variability Case Study**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This case study provides a visual sense for the natural variability in long-term temperature trends across time scales and
    spatial scales, and the discernment of significant changes outside of
    this natural variability. Shown in the two figures below are the surface-temperature trends since 1880 comparing the observed temperature record
    of two domains: 1) “Global: Land + Ocean” (first figure) and, 2)
    “Global: Land Only” (second figure). The blue line in the graph depicts
    the global mean annual temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2014. An
    “anomaly” is simply the departure of a temperature from a baseline, in
    this case the average temperature. For example, if the average
    temperature for today is 15°C but the actual temperature is 18°C, then
    the temperature anomaly is +3°C. If the actual temperature was 12°C,
    then the anomaly would be -3°C. In these two times series, the anomalies
    are based on the 30-year average from 1951-1980. Therefore, the
    anomalies show the departure of each average annual temperature from
    that 30-year average. The red line represents the trend for the entire
    1880-2014 period. You can see year-to-year variability in the anomalies,
    as well as variability on the decadal time scale.

    |image11|

    |image12|

    The overall warming trend (red line) for “Global: Land Only” is a
    bit steeper than “Global: Land + Ocean”. The “Land Only” trend shows
    more than a +0.5°C departure from the mean by 2014, while the "Land +
    Ocean” trend shows a little less than a +0.5°C departure. Due to the
    oceans' ability to store heat, the global warming trend is a bit slower
    when they are included. This, then, also highlights the dependence of
    land-temperature variability on its proximity to large water bodies.

    Below we highlight the dependence on the variability to (smaller)
    spatial scale, showing the trend for the Contiguous United States.

    |image13|

    The “Contiguous United States” trend shows a little less rapid
    warming than the “Global: Land Only" areas, but the year-to-year
    variability is much greater. Generally, the variability will continue to
    increase as the spatial domain covered decreases. The 48 contiguous
    states make up only 1.6% of the global surface and are not, by
    themselves, a good measure of global trends.

    Next we focus on the dependence of trend on time period, and
    again examine the “Global: Land + Ocean” domain (shown below). If we
    were to fit 10-year trend lines over differing periods of this record,
    one would find 10-year periods with upward, downward, and no trend in
    temperature. For example, the decade of 1941-1950 shows distinct
    cooling, while the overlapping decade of 1933-1942 shows very distinct
    warming. Since the mid-20th century, 10-year temperature trends are
    mainly warming, although there are flat periods as well as year-to-year
    variation (noting that the last 10-year period shown in the graph below,
    2005-2014, has no trend but is warmer than every other 10-year period in
    the 20th century). Internal variability drivers are the predominant
    mechanisms for this year-by-year, decadal-by-decadal trend variability
    and the motivation to “smooth over” this variability is one reason why
    both the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) accept 30 years as the
    period of time used to define a climate station’s “climate normals”.
    Note that one of the “climate-normal” periods is shown below covering
    1938-1967.

    |image14|

    Interestingly, during this 30-year period (1938-1967) the global
    surface temperature actually decreased by about 0.1°C, and was caused by
    sulfate particles from the increased
    burning of fossil fuels backspattering to space, and was thus a cooling anthropogenic climate
    driver. However, this trend stopped once the United States and other
    countries began to lower sulfur emissions in the 1970s to reduce acid
    rain and respiratory illnesses (since 1975, the average global
    temperature has risen by about 0.15-0.2°C per decade). This observed
    cooling effect is one reason why the injection of sulfate aerosols into
    the upper atmosphere is actively being considered as one mechanism of
    geoengineering to limit global warming.

   Attribution of Extreme Weather Events in the Context of Climate
   Change (NAS, 2016)

*Detection –* Detection and attribution are two important concepts in
the field of climate science, particularly when studying climate change.
Detection refers to the process of demonstrating that some aspect of
climate has changed in some statistical sense, without providing a
reason for that change. It is about identifying a significant change in
the climate system (temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, shifts in
seasonal cycles, etc.) that is above and beyond the natural internal
variability of the system. Detection does not imply understanding the
cause of changes; it's about observing (or making a determination beyond
a level of significance) that a change has occurred, and provides the
basis for attributing these changes to specific causes, such as human
activities. Because of the presence of natural variability and other
noise in the data under study, distinguishing a climate-change induced
signal is more often a statistical process (e.g. a detectable observed
change is one which is determined to be highly unlikely to occur – say,
less than about a 10% chance – due to internal variability alone).

The popout below provides an overview of the changes in climate variable
statistical distributions that could result from climate change. In
context of detection, there are a variety of statistical tests that can
be used to test the significance of differences between distributions
(e.g. the Kolmorgorav-Smirnov two sample test that two data samples come
from the same distribution; NIST, 2023; Chakravart et al., 1967; Press
et al., 1992).

.. dropdown::  Climate change and extremes

    **Climate Change and Extremes**
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Just as changes in annual and seasonal mean temperature and
    precipitation are very important to water research and resources,
    depending on the particular focus of the planning, changes in short
    duration extremes can be very important too. Extremes can have direct
    impacts on habitat, and pose risks to infrastructure. It is important to
    get a sense for what extremes represent from a statistical standpoint.
    Extreme weather is a bit relative. For example, a hot day in
    Wyoming would be considered a mild one in Arizona. And we don't
    generally notice changes in climate because most weather falls within
    the range of what is expected. It is mainly the extreme events that get
    our attention—events that are outside our normal experience and that
    often inflict human suffering. So how might global warming affect
    climate extremes and extreme weather? There are several possible ways.

    Temperature at a given location can be roughly represented with a bell
    curve or a normal distribution, similar to the top panel in the figure
    below, with the majority of the observations in the middle, hot
    and cold events in the tails of the curve, but with rare events
    of extremely cold or extremely warm temperatures at the ends.
    Global warming could shift the distribution to the right when
    the average temperature increases. Temperatures that used to be
    unusually high become more common, while heat levels not reached before
    become more probable. Cold extremes still occur, but become less common.
    Although not shown here, a:mark:`nother possibility is that climate
    change increases the variance (or width) in the distribution of
    temperature—in other words, it increases the range of possibilities at
    both ends of the distribution. Or climate change could result in a
    combination of the two types of distributions. We don't *a priori* know
    exactly how the distributions of weather variables in each specific
    location will be impacted.

    |Graphic depicting how a warmer climate affects extremes in temperature
    and precipitation|

    Precipitation curves have only one tail for the extreme precipitation
    events, as shown in the bottom panel of the figure above (with
    the two-parameter gamma traditionally used; Ye et al., 2018). In a
    warmer climate with more atmospheric water vapor, generally, more
    intense precipitation events become more common. Recent observations
    back this up, with high-end precipitation events becoming less rare than
    they have been, in general.



*Attribution –* On the other hand, attribution deals with determining
the most likely causes for those detected changes in the climate. This
involves assessing the various natural and anthropogenic (human-induced)
factors that could have led to the observed changes, with these often
complex, interacting factors that can range in scales from molecular to
global, seconds to millennia. Attribution studies can use statistical
tests as well as climate models, to evaluate the relative contributions
of various causes to climate change (along with an assignment of
statistical confidence), like greenhouse gas emissions, solar radiation,
and volcanic activity, with the latter (coupled climate models) being an
especially powerful tool with potential to turn on and off factors in
controlled numerical simulations of the areas and events of interest. A
supporting concept is the idea of emergence of a climate change signal
or trend, referring to when a change in climate (the ‘signal’) becomes
larger than the amplitude of natural or internal variations (defining
the ‘noise’) (AR6). This concept is often expressed as a
‘signal-to-noise’ ratio (S/N) and emergence occurs at a defined
threshold of this ratio (e.g., S/N >1 or 2) (Chen et al., 2021).

*Elements of a Detection and Attribution Study –* The AR6 Cross-Working
Group Box on Attribution (Hope et al., 2021) provides a brief discussion
and figure (reproduced below), on *Steps towards an attribution
assessment*; and a similar discussion on four core elements to any
detection and attribution study is also provided in AR5 WG1 (Bindoff et
al., 2013: *10.2.1 The Context of Detection and Attribution*). Taken
together the following general steps are identified: a) the unambiguous
framing of what changes are being attributed to; b) clearly define the
indicators of the observed change or event, including observations of
one or more climate variables, such as surface temperature, that are
understood, on physical grounds, to be relevant to the process in
question, and note the quality of the observations; c) the
identification of the possible and plausible drivers of change,
including an estimate of how external drivers of climate change have
evolved before and during the period under investigation, including both
the driver whose influence is being investigated (such as rising
greenhouse gas levels) and potential confounding influences (such as
solar activity); d) the development of a hypothesis or theory for the
linkage with a quantitative physically based understanding, normally
encapsulated in a model, of how these external drivers are thought to
have affected these observed climate variables; e) and a system or
method to test the hypothesis or theory, typically including an
estimate, often but not always derived from a physically based model, of
the characteristics of variability expected in these observed climate
variables due to random, quasi-periodic and chaotic fluctuations
generated in the climate system that are not due to externally driven
climate change.

|image15|

*Figure: Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, Figure 1 \|
Schematic of the steps to develop an attribution assessment, and the
purposes of such assessments. Methods and systems used to test the
attribution hypothesis or theory include: model-based fingerprinting;
other model-based methods; evidence-based fingerprinting; process-based
approaches; empirical or decomposition methods; and the use of multiple
lines of evidence. Many of the methods are based on the comparison of
the observed state of a system to a hypothetical counterfactual world
that does not include the driver of interest to help estimate the causes
of the observed response.*

*Attribution Methods –* Concerning the attribution methods or system to
test the hypothesis or theory, Bindoff et al. (2013) highlight that the
attribution of observed changes is not possible without some kind of
model of the relationship between external climate drivers and
observable variables given that we cannot observe a world in which
either anthropogenic or natural forcing is absent. Such models may be
very simple (e.g. a set of statistical assumptions) or very complex
(e.g. coupled Earth System Model), and that it is not necessary (or
possible) for them to be correct in all respects, but they must provide
a physically consistent representation of processes and scales relevant
to the attribution problem in question.

Some of the most powerful tools in the attribution process are models of
the system of interest that use “what if” approaches to isolate the
impacts of anthropogenic (and other) factors that are hypothesized to be
driving the changes in the observed record. It is to be noted with very
high confidence (IPCC, 2021) that the CMIP6 model ensemble reproduces
the observed historical global surface temperature trend and variability
with biases small enough to support detection and attribution of
human-induced warming (Eyring, et al., 2021), and that CMIP6 also
includes an extensive set of idealized and single forcing experiments
for attribution (Eyring et al., 2016; Gillett et al., 2016), but with
the important caveat that numerical models, however complex, cannot be a
perfect representation of the real world, and their use requires
considering the limitations of each model simulation (see 1.5.4 in Chen
et al., 2021). The figure below highlights an earlier effort that used
the “what if” approach on a global scale, where the impacts of
anthropogenic forcings are isolated through the use of NCAR’s coupled
Earth System Model. Trajectories of past global mean temperatures have
been estimated using experiments that do not incorporate anthropogenic
forcing produce the trajectory shown with the blue line and the light
blue uncertainty bounds. The black line shows the observed global mean
temperatures. You can see that the experiments that do not include
anthropogenic forcings fail to reproduce the warming that has been
observed over the past half century. Experiments were also run that do
include anthropogenic forcings. This trajectory is shown with the red
line and pink uncertainty bounds. You can see that when anthropogenic
forcings are included, the global climate models do produce results that
very closely match the observed warming trends. This suggests that
anthropogenic factors have emerged as a significant contributor to
global warming.

|image16|

A more recent approach in climate modeling for detection and attribution
is to run a "Large Ensemble" of historical (and future) simulations,
where each member of the ensemble is subject to natural+anthropogenic
external forcings, but starts from a slightly different initial
condition, which results in a different trajectory of internal
variability once the memory of the initial state is lost. One can
estimate the forced component from the ensemble-average at any point in
time, since the internal component is randomly phased across the
different members of the ensemble. The figure below (Deser et al., 2020)
illustrates how the random phasing of internal variability of 60-year
trends over North America can obscure the forced trend at any given
location. Note the regional differences in the spatial patterns of the
trends over this time period (comparing the coldest and warmest ensemble
members for the same model on the bottom row); and by extension, how
much greater the natural variability is at these smaller spatial scales.
Such Large Ensembles, then, provide context for interpreting observed
trends. In this context, the actual observed trajectory can be
considered as one realization of many possible alternative worlds that
experienced different weather. This can also be demonstrated by the
construction of ‘observation-based large ensembles’, which are alternate
possible realizations of historical observations that retain the
statistical properties of observed regional weather (e.g., McKinnon and
Deser, 2018; Chen, et al., 2021). Referring back to the concept of
signal-to-noise and to the second panel of the figure, the ratio of the
mean shift from zero of the distributions (forced signal) compared to
(some metric of) their spread (internal variability “noise”) provides a
degree of the emergence in the anthropogenically-forced North America
heating trend.

two LEs (CESM1 in green and MPI in purple); bottom row, individual
ensemble members from CESM1 (green) and MPI (purple) with the weakest

that they reflect forced and internal contributions. From: Deser et al.,

Generally, attribution methods are grouped into two categories:
*Attribution of observed climate change to anthropogenic forcing* and
*Attribution of weather and climate events to anthropogenic forcing*, as
will the discussion that follows. Because the focus of this primer is on
climate change impacts on North America water studies, the focus in what
follows will be on regional approaches to this topic, referencing
Doblas-Reyes, et al. (2021) for the discussion of *Attribution of
observed climate change to anthropogenic forcing*, referencing
Seneviratne et al. (2021) for *Attribution of weather and climate events
to anthropogenic forcing*, and we refer the reader to Eyring et al.
(2021) for a discussion of the methods used for global-scale studies.

*Attribution Methods: Attribution of observed climate change to
anthropogenic forcing –* Here, regional-scale attribution is the process
of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors (or
drivers) to regional climate change. Specific regional conditions and
responses may simplify or complicate attribution on those scales. In
general, regional climate variations are larger than the global mean
climate, adding additional uncertainty to attribution. In contrast with
global-scale attribution methods where internal variability might be
considered as a noise problem, the preliminary detection step is not
always required to perform regional-scale attribution since causal
factors of regional climate change may also include internal modes of
variability in addition to external natural and anthropogenic forcing.
Other complicating factors include an increased similarity among the
responses to different external forcings leading to a more difficult
discrimination of their effects, the importance at regional scale of
some omitted forcings in global model simulations, and model biases
related to the representation of small-scale phenomena (Zhai et al.,
2018). These statistical limitations may be reduced by *process-based
(or regional-scale) attribution*, focusing on the physical processes
known to influence the response to external forcing and internal
variability. We provide a summary of these attribution methodologies in
what follows, after first noting that these methodologies rely upon the
availability of high-quality observational datasets as well as
multi-model simulations of the historical period constrained by
different external forcing combinations, including single-forcing
experiments and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs).

Standard approaches include *optimal fingerprinting* methods that are
based on multivariate linear regression and assume that the observed
change consists of a linear combination of externally forced signals
plus internal variability. The main goal is to determine the extent to
which observed climate changes can be attributed to specific external
forcings. The regressors are the expected space–time response patterns
to different climate forcings (fingerprints), and the residuals
represent internal variability. Steps in *optimal fingerprinting*
include:

1. Model Simulation:

   -  Control Runs: These simulations run climate models with no
      external forcings, representing natural variability.

   -  Forced Runs: These simulations include different external forcings
      (e.g., greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar radiation).

2. Fingerprint Identification:

   -  Pattern Recognition: Using climate models, scientists identify the
      spatial and temporal patterns of climate response (fingerprints)
      to each type of forcing.

   -  Signal Estimation: The patterns represent the expected climate
      response to specific forcings.

3. Statistical Analysis:

   -  Linear Regression: The observed climate data is expressed as a
      linear combination of the fingerprints plus a residual term
      representing natural variability.

   -  Estimation: The coefficients in the regression indicate the
      strength of each forcing's contribution to the observed changes.

4. Optimal Filtering:

   -  Noise Reduction: Statistical techniques are used to filter out the
      noise (natural variability) from the signal (forced response).

   -  Weighting: Optimal weighting is applied to maximize the
      signal-to-noise ratio, enhancing the detection of the
      fingerprints.

Regional studies that have used this approach to detect multi-decadal
precipitation changes due to anthropogenic forcing for several regions
include: Ma et al., 2017; Song et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017; Tian et
al., 2018; Delworth and Zeng (2014); and Dey et al., 2019a, b.

*Other Spatiotemporal Statistical Methods –* From Doblas-Reyes et al.
(2021), The primary objective of any attribution method is to optimally
separate the influences of external forcing and internal variability on
a global or regional climate record. In a multi-model ensemble context,
the estimation of the externally-forced climate response has been
typically performed by ensemble averaging of linear trends or regional
domain spatial average, thus not taking into account the available and
complete space and time covariance information. Methods using
spatiotemporal information to improve the separation between external
and internal drivers in multiple or single historical climate
realizations performed by a given global model include pattern filtering
methods such as signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal
functions (Ting et al., 2009); dynamical adjustment to extract the
response to external forcing in an observed or simulated single
realization (Smoliak et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2016; Sippel et al.,
2019); time scale separation methods (DelSole et al., 2011; Wills et
al., 2018, 2020); and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method
(Wu and Huang, 2009; Wilcox et al., 2013; Ji et al., 2014; Qian and
Zhou, 2014), which decomposes data, such as time series of historical
temperature and precipitation, into independent oscillatory modes of
decreasing frequency..

*Attribution Methods: Attribution of weather and climate events to
anthropogenic forcing –* Here with reference to Hope et al. (2021) and
Seneviratne, et al. (2021), we discuss methods to attribute the change
in likelihood or characteristics of weather or climate events or classes
of events to underlying drivers, where typically, historical changes,
simulated under observed forcings, are compared to a counterfactual
climate simulated in the absence of anthropogenic forcing.

The outcome of event attribution is dependent on the definition of the
event (Leach et al., 2020), as well as the framing (Otto et al., 2016;
Christidis et al., 2018; Jézéquel et al., 2018) and uncertainties in
observations and modeling. Attribution statements are also dependent on
the spatial (Uhe et al., 2016; Cattiaux and Ribes, 2018;
Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019) and temporal (Harrington, 2017; Leach et
al., 2020) extent of event definitions, as events of different scales
involve different processes (Zhang et al., 2020) and large-scale
averages generally yield higher attributable changes in magnitude or
probability due to the smoothing out of noise. In general, confidence in
attribution statements for large-scale heat and lengthy extreme
precipitation events have higher confidence than shorter and more
localized events, such as extreme storms, an aspect also relevant for
determining the emergence of signals in extremes or the confidence in
projections (see also the tables of confidence in extremes for North
America in the next section).

Trend detection using optimal fingerprinting methods is a
well-established field. However, there are specific challenges when
applying optimal fingerprinting to the detection and attribution of
trends in extremes and on regional scales where the lower signal-
to-noise ratio is a challenge.

Apart from the detection and attribution of trends in extremes, new
approaches have been developed to answer the question of whether, and to
what extent, external drivers have altered the probability and intensity
of an individual extreme event (NASEM, 2016). A commonly used approach –
often called the risk-based approach in the literature, and referred to
here as the ‘probability-based approach’ – produces statements such as
‘anthropogenic climate change made this event type twice as likely’ or
‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 15% more intense’. This is
done by estimating probability distributions of the index characterizing
the event in today’s climate, as well as in a counterfactual climate,
and either comparing intensities for a given occurrence probability
(e.g., 1-in-100-year event) or probabilities for a given magnitude.
There are a number of different analytical methods encompassed in the
probability-based approach, building on observations and statistical
analyses (e.g., van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), optimal fingerprint
methods (Sun et al., 2014), regional climate and weather forecast models
(e.g., Schaller et al., 2016), global climate models (GCMs) (e.g., Lewis
and Karoly, 2013), and large ensembles of atmosphere-only GCMs (e.g.,
Lott et al., 2013).

Another approach examines facets of the weather and thermodynamic status
of an event through process-based attribution (Hauser et al., 2016;
Shepherd et al., 2018; Grose et al., 2018). Using these techniques,
attributable human influence has been found for heavy precipitation, and
certain types of droughts and tropical cyclones (e.g., Herring et al.,
2021).


5.4 Observed Climate Impacts
------------------------------

|image18|

**What are we certain about?** On a global scale we know that sea
and land ice volume are decreasing as average temperature, evaporation,
and atmospheric water vapor are increasing.

**What are we pretty sure about?** There are likely to be some
regional differences from the global averages, but most regions are
likely to experience the following:

-  more frequent wet and/or dry extremes brought about by warmer
   temperatures,

-  increased evapotranspiration, and

-  changes to precipitation intensity, distribution, and phase
   (liquid versus frozen).

These changes may lie outside the range of observations in the
period of record, and will need to be taken into account in water
research and resources planning.


.. dropdown::  Trends Impacting Water and Environmental Resources Planning

    The following observed and/or projected trends have an impact on planning for water and environmental resources.

    - Global average temperature has been warming and will continue to warm through the 21st century

    - Short-term natural cycles of increased warming interspersed with cooling (or slower warming) will be superimposed on the overall long-term warming

    - Average snow cover and snowpack in the United States is likely to decrease through the 21st century

    - Precipitation extremes (wet and dry) are likely to continue increasing through the 21st century, with some regional trends toward either more wet or more dry

    These climate trends have, and will continue to have, impacts on water resources 


The need for understanding the influence of climate change on the U.S.
water sector, its impacts, and need for informed decision-making across
the U.S. is highlighted in The Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5;

discussion) produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, with
the following key message, “The effects of human-caused climate change
are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United
States.” In addition, the NCA5 states that, “Changes in multiple aspects
of climate are apparent in every U.S. region … warming is apparent in
every region … average annual precipitation is increasing in most
regions, except in the Northwest, Southwest, and Hawai‘i, where
precipitation has decreased … heavy precipitation events are increasing
everywhere except Hawai‘i and the US Caribbean” (see NCA5 for further
information on how CC affects the U.S.’s physical Earth systems, current
and future risks, and what can be done to reduce those risks, in each of
the 10 NCA5-defined regions.

*The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have
increased across much of the United States, particularly the eastern
part of the continental US, with implications for flood risk and
infrastructure planning. Maps show observed changes in three measures of
extreme precipitation: (a) total precipitation falling on the heaviest
1% of days, (b) daily maximum precipitation in a 5-year period, and (c)
the annual heaviest daily precipitation amount over 1958–2021. Numbers
in black circles depict percent changes at the regional level. Data were
not available for the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands and the US Virgin
Islands. Figure credits: from NCA5, (a) adapted from Easterling et al.

*Over much of the country, the risk of warm nights has increased while
the risk of cold days has decreased. The risk of hot days has also
increased across the western US. This figure shows the observed change
in the number of (a) hot days (days at or above 95°F), (b) cold days
(days at or below 32°F), and (c) warm nights (nights at or above 70°F)
over the period 2002–2021 relative to 1901–1960 (1951–1980 for Alaska
and Hawai‘i and 1956–1980 for Puerto Rico). Data were not available for
the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Figure

*Precipitation Variability and Trends –* Unlike temperature, it is much
more difficult to detect a steady global trend in precipitation,
although trends toward wetter or drier conditions exist in certain
regions. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor. This can lead to
longer precipitation-free periods, but also more intense precipitation
when it does rain or snow.

*Percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in the
heaviest 1% of all daily events (1958 to 2012) for different regions of
the contiguous United States. The changes in the Southwest are likely
masked by high natural variability. (Figure source: from NCA5, updated
from Karl et al. 2009).*

Observations in the United States from 1958-2012 show that the amount of
precipitation falling in the heaviest 1% of daily events is increasing
in all states except Hawaii. The Northeast and upper Midwest have the
most notable increase in intense precipitation. The interrelationships
between precipitation and other climate variables are important to
hydrology. Temperature affects the hydrological cycle due to its
influence on evapotranspiration, water temperature, precipitation phase,
and melting, among other things.

In the western part of the contiguous United States, the observed trend
in April 1st snowpack is decreasing in a majority of locations,
especially the northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest.

Multidecadal wet and dry episodes are labeled. Precipitation is
expressed as mean deviation from individual station averages. USGS*

Historic observations in the southwestern United States show multi-year
periods of both positive and negative annual precipitation anomalies
rather than a long-term trend in precipitation amount. Because the
warmer temperatures of recent decades can contribute to greater
evapotranspiration, the negative precipitation anomalies may result in
more severe drought compared to similar negative precipitation anomalies
of the early 20th century.

*Trends in Extremes –* Observation-based studies show that natural
variability in temperature continues on the background of overall
warming. Precipitation trends show a tendency for more extremes, both
wet and dry, on a global scale, with some regional trends toward either
wetter or drier overall.

Typically, water research, resources planning, operations, and
management already consider natural climate variability. As we move into
the future, natural climate variability will continue, but it will be
superimposed on a trend caused by climate change. As the “background”
climate warms the global mean, the extremes associated with natural
variability may reach magnitudes rarely or never before seen in the
observed record.

*Regional Information on Extremes –* The table below are taken from IPCC
AR6 (Seneviratne et al., 2021) and provides summary regional assessments
for hot extremes (HOT EXT.), heavy precipitation (HEAVY PRECIP.),
agriculture and ecological droughts (AGR./ECOL. DROUGHT), and
hydrological droughts (HYDR. DROUGHT). It shows the direction of change
and level of confidence in the observed trends (column OBS.), human
contribution to observed trends (ATTR.), and projected changes at 1.5°C,
2°C and 4°C of global warming for each AR6 region. Projections are shown
for two different baseline periods: 1850–1900 (pre-industrial) and
1995–2014 (modern or recent past) (see Seneviratne et al., 2021 Section
1.4.1 for more details). Direction of change is represented by an upward
arrow (increase) and a downward arrow (decrease). Level of confidence is
reported for LOW: low, MED.: medium, HIGH: high; levels of likelihood
(only in cases of high confidence) include: L: likely , VL: very likely
, EL: extremely likely , VC: virtual certain. Dark orange shading
highlights high confidence (also including likely , very likely ,
extremely likely and virtually certain changes) increases in hot
temperature extremes, agricultural and ecological drought, or
hydrological droughts. Yellow indicates medium confidence increases in
these extremes, and blue shadings indicate decreases in these extremes.
High confidence increases in heavy precipitation are highlighted in dark
blue, while medium confidence increases are highlighted in light blue.
No assessment for changes in drought with respect to the 1995–2014
baseline is provided, which is why the respective cells are
empty.\ |image25|
