**Introduction**

In any study on future impacts of climate change, it is essential to
first characterize and quantify the baseline or starting point of the
study area of interest, which includes understanding the natural
variability of the water system being studied, independent of
anthropogenic impacts (e.g. due to, say, changes in radiative forcing
due to changes in CO2 emissions, land-use changes, etc.). In addition,
when using future numerical-based climate modeling outputs, some form of
bias correction using local observations is also essential for making
the results physically-relevant, as well as making the climate model
outputs applicable as inputs into local impact models. The first part of
this chapter discusses observational data sources that would be relevant
for both of these topics. Note that our coverage of climate variables in
this primer is primarily on the atmospheric “flux” terms into and out of
the surface (see figure below) of the hydrologic cycle components:
precipitation and the climate variables that impact evapotranspiration
(temperature, solar insolation, long wave radiation, wind speed,
relative humidity); this is in contrast to those variables that are
subsurface variables, and those that are more “point-based” and
diagnosed through local impact model research (e.g. streamflow, sediment
transport, storage, etc.).

*The components of the hydrologic cycle*

In the second section of this chapter we discuss the concept of the
baseline natural variability of a system under study, and ways to detect
and potentially attribute the contribution of observed changes to
natural and anthropogenic factors. Because climate change is a
phenomenon that is typically characterized by slow changes through time,
and that anthropogenic-induced climate change predominantly began in the
mid-19th century (when atmospheric concentrations of CO2 began to show a
marked increase correlating with industrial activities), significant
changes may be detected through examination of the historical record,
depending on the study area. At the same time, detection depends on how
large the “natural variability” of the system of interest is. The
Earth's climate systems exhibit natural variability due to a range of
factors. These include variations in solar radiation (e.g. solar
cycles), volcanic activity, ocean currents, atmospheric circulation
patterns such as El Niño and La Niña, and geological processes like the
shifting of tectonic plates (at time-scales of millions of years).
Additionally, feedback mechanisms within the Earth's climate system can
amplify or dampen these variations, leading to fluctuations in
temperature, precipitation patterns, and other climatic parameters over
different timescales, from years to centuries and beyond. The figure
below from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC:
https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/figures/figure-2-1) shows on the left
panel the increase in the global surface temperature through time, while
the panel at the right shows estimates of how much these temperature
changes have been attributed to total human influence; solar and
volcanic drivers; and internal climate variability. Although at the
global scale, human impacts are the dominant contributor to these
changes, natural variability generally becomes relatively a much larger
contributor to observed changes as the spatial region of interest gets
smaller, and as the timescales of interest also decrease.

Further below we provide introductory information on the distinction of
weather and climate (i.e. differences in what are often termed “time
scales of interest”) and a description of the natural factors that
influence our climate over time.

    Most of us know that climate and weather are not the same. It is sometimes said, "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."

    **Weather** describes the details of what we experience over the course of hours and days.

    |image1|

    :mark:`**Climate** is the statistical representation of weather over days, months, seasons, years, decades and longer`

|image2|

:mark:`**A weather prediction, or forecast,** describes the near-term
likelihood of a weather event such as a specific occurrence of rain or
snow and/or the expected change in temperature. A weather forecast, for
example, might read, "colder with a 70% chance of snow this afternoon."`

:mark:`**A climate prediction**, on the other hand, might call for below
average precipitation and near average temperature over the next 30
days.`

:mark:`**Climate model output:** used to generate statistics of weather
phenomena`

-  :mark:`Mean and variability of precipitation and temperature`

-  :mark:`Collective impact of weather events`

:mark:`**Projections:** Lack specificity and predictability`

:mark:`Climate models do predict specific weather events many years into
the future, but not with the intention for use as time and site-specific
forecasts. Rather, the intended use of climate model output is to
generate statistics of weather phenomena, such as means and variability
of precipitation or temperature, and thus to characterize the collective
impact of weather events. These climate predictions are typically
referred to as projections, or simulations, and lack the short-term
specificity of weather predictions.`
