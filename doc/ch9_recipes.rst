Recipe 1: Preparing Hydro-climate Inputs for Climate Change in Water Resource Planning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement:  You have been asked to prepare temperature and precipitation future climate data inputs for general use in impact models for climate change impacts, such as:

* Surface water hydrology
* Crop irrigation water requirements
* Inland water temperature
* Sediment transport
* Long term planning of water resources

Climate changes, particularly changes in temperature and precipitation, have a direct impact on two key elements of the hydrologic cycle: evaporation and precipitation. Other elements of the hydrologic cycle—snowmelt, runoff, surface streamflow, and storage—are consequently impacted. We will focus on the development of temperature and precipitation inputs (focusing on amount, not phase) that can be used for modeling the other elements of the hydrologic cycle.
