Climate Primer Motivation: Empathy Interviews
-------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this Climate Primer is to provide succinct guidance to
the USGS for using climate and climate change information most effectively, focusing on the needs and priorities of the Water Mission Area
(WMA). There is a vast amount of climate and climate-change data
available and this Primer is meant to help navigate what can often be an
overwhelming amount of information. To guide the development of the
Primer, the NCAR team conducted hour-long interviews with 6 members of
the WMA, which included research hydrologists and a data
scientist/ecologist. The goal of the interviews was to learn how
USGS scientists are using climate and climate-change information in the
WMA, questions and struggles when using the information, and
what type of support would be most useful to them regarding climate and
climate-change information.

The following is a list of questions that were posed to the interviewees:

1) What is the main water concern you are working on (e.g., groundwater
   / surface-water interactions, salinity, ecological flows)? Why is it
   important? How does climate impact that component?

2) How do you and/or your organization view climate change (e.g. itâ€™s
   important and we need to include it; we would like to include it but
   not sure of best approach or are resource-constrained; it is not one
   of our top concerns)?

3) Have you used climate and climate change information (observations, 
   weather/climate forecasts, or climate change model simulations)? If so, how
   have you used them? What was your best/worst experience using
   climate and climate change information?

4) What time horizon do you plan for?

5) What are you most curious about/least understand/want to know more
   about concerning climate change in general, and with respect to
   climate change information being provided by the IPCC/CMIP/climate
   change modeling community?

6) Do you have enough background knowledge on climate science to be
   dangerous?

7) Any final thoughts/feedback on the primer and/or interview
   process that you would like to share?

The interviews resulted in rich discussions on the focus and goals of
the USGS WMA along with where gaps in
expertise exist and what kind of support would be most useful from the perspective of those
interviewed. Below is a summary of areas where the USGS WMA
focused their work and areas where this group could use more
guidance for understanding and using climate and climate-change data.

**Selection of water concerns USGS Water Mission Area is working on**\ *:*

-  Coordinating broad water-availability assessments - historical and
   future

   -  Water supply, demand, and quality

   -  Components of the water cycle (precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture,
      streamflow, surface water, groundwater)

-  Water-budget components and connections with groundwater/surface-water
   interactions, dissolved solids, other water quality

-  Land use and management impacts on water

-  Past and future snow impacts

-  Stream and lake temperatures, salinity, nitrates

-  Frequency thresholds are exceeded

-  Spatial and temporal covariability

**Desired information from a climate primer**\ *:*

-  Basics of climate-change data

   -  How to evaluate datasets

      -  Which datasets are good for past vs. future analysis?

      -  Are some datasets "better" than others and, if so, why?

   -  Where to obtain datasets, scripts to help with downloading and
      converting datasets

   -  Understanding downscaling

   -  Uncertainties, biases, limitations

      -  How to characterize and quantify uncertainties

      -  Understand how biases impact results

-  Recommendations for good observational datasets

-  Provide a "standardized approach" for using climate and climate-change information

   -  How to go from observation to climate-change impacts

   -  What to do if there are data gaps

-  High-level overview to understand main issues

   -  How to decipher what is "real" and what to trust in the literature

   -  Glossary of terms

-  Guidelines on how to present outputs in a reasonable way

-  Understanding of attribution (what was from climate vs. other
   drivers)

-  How to combine multiple future projections of drivers, e.g.,
   future land use with future climate
