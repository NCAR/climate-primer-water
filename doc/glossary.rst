Anthropogenic: environmental change caused or influenced by people, either directly or indirectly

AOGCM (Atmosphere-Ocean GCM)

Bias Biases in climate models are errors when compared to observations. They can be caused by a range of factors due to limited spatial resolution (large grid sizes), simplified thermodynamic processes and physics or incomplete understanding of the global climate system.

Bias-Correction Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) Method Corrected for AOGCM biases, and
generated model data with high spatial resolution from the original coarser resolution AOGCM data.

Boundary value: a data value that corresponds to a minimum or maximum input, internal, or output value specified for a system or component

Climate: the long-term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years

Climate change scenarios: plausible climate futures, taking into account increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses, and usually constructed from computer-based models of the Earth-Ocean-Atmosphere system.

Climate Forcings: factors that cause physical processes affecting the climate on the Earth (examples: solar radiation, albedo, greenhouse gasses, temperature)

CMIP A collaborative framework designed to improve knowledge of climate change by standardizing global climate model (GCM) experiments and model output, comparing/evaluating GCMs, and make GCM data publicly available. “Coupled” refers to the interconnected components of the climate system (i.e., land, air, water, etc.) that are simulated by the climate models; “intercomparison” references the many models that are available to compare with observations and to one another to characterize model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty. The CMIP project started in 1995 and has multiple versions, including CMIP3 (2005), CMIP5 (2011), and CMIP6 (2018) - there was no CMIP4.

Emission Scenarios: possible pathways that society might take in the emission of greenhouse gasses and aerosol concentrations in the future

GCM (General Circulation Model, sometimes called Global Climate Model) numerical models representing physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surface

Initial Value

IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change)the scientific group assembled by the United Nations to monitor and assess all global science related to climate change
 
Narratives:Combination of projections and scenarios.

Period Change Approach

Predictions an attempt to produce a most likely description or estimate of
the actual evolution of the the future

Projections: Climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative
forcing scenario used,

Radiative forcing A measure of how the energy balance of the Earth–atmosphere system is influenced. The word 'radiative forcing' is used because these factors change the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared (IR) radiation within the Earth's atmosphere.

RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) is a greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions) trajectory adopted by the IPCC.

Scenarios: Non-climate potential futures (management options, 

Shared Socio-economic Pathways Climate change scenarios of  projected socioeconomic global changes as defined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on climate change in 2021. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing broad socioeconomic trends that could shape future society. These are intended to span the range of plausible futures, including: a world of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1); a “middle of the road” world where trends broadly follow their historical patterns (SSP2); a fragmented world of “resurgent nationalism” (SSP3); a world of ever-increasing inequality (SSP4); and a world of rapid and unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5).

SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) scenarios constructed to explore future developments in the global environment with special reference to the production of greenhouse gasses and aerosol precursor emissions

Time Slices

Uncertainty: The degree to which the measured value of some quantity is estimated to vary from the true value.Uncertainty can arise from a variety of sources.

Water Availability: Water available for human and ecosystem use. Includes amount, timing,  delivery rates, ….

Weather: the state of the atmosphere, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloud cover
