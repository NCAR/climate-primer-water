**Weather vs Climate**

Most of us know that climate and weather are not the same. It is
sometimes said, "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."

**Weather** describes the details of what we experience over the course
of hours and days.

:mark:`**Climate** is the statistical representation of weather over
days, months, seasons, years, decades and longer`

:mark:`**A weather prediction, or forecast,** describes the near-term
likelihood of a weather event such as a specific occurrence of rain or
snow and/or the expected change in temperature. A weather forecast, for
example, might read, "colder with a 70% chance of snow this afternoon."`

:mark:`**A climate prediction**, on the other hand, might call for below
average precipitation and near average temperature over the next 30
days.`

:mark:`**Climate model output:** used to generate statistics of weather
phenomena`

-  :mark:`Mean and variability of precipitation and temperature`

-  :mark:`Collective impact of weather events`

:mark:`**Projections:** Lack specificity and predictability`

:mark:`Climate models do predict specific weather events many years into
the future, but not with the intention for use as time and site-specific
forecasts. Rather, the intended use of climate model output is to
generate statistics of weather phenomena, such as means and variability
of precipitation or temperature, and thus to characterize the collective
impact of weather events. These climate predictions are typically
referred to as projections, or simulations, and lack the short-term
specificity of weather predictions.`
