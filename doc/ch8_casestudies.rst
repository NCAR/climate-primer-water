Case Study 2: Compound Flooding Impacts due to Tropical Cyclones under Climate Change
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Motivation:**

The East Coast U.S. was severely impacted by Hurricane Irene in 2011. The region was primed by an abnormally wet 2 weeks prior to the hurricane's landfall. Heavy rainfall from the hurricane, saturated soils, and storm surge combined to cause severe flooding along the heavily populated U.S. East Coast. See this `Storymap <https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/fa28d98081594cf3b2dd9ce3a6d7018b>`_ from the Mid-Atlantic River Forecast Center for a nice overview of the event.

**Question:**

What would the flooding impacts of Hurricane Irene look like under a warmer climate? How do the combined effects of antecedent conditions, sea level rise, and hurricane characteristics change under a warmer climate? Do these factors compound or mitigate flooding impacts?

**Considerations:**

*  Flooding impacts, particularly in urban and coastal zones, require hydrodynamic models. These models are generally *high-resolution* (in both time and space), *process complex*, and *data and compute intensive*.

   *  We need high temporal and spatial resolution data products.
   *  Precipitation is most important, but we also need wind and pressure fields (coastal dynamics) and temperature and humidity (antecedent land conditions).
   *  We are limited in the number of simulations we can reasonably do.

*  We are interested in evaluating impacts of an *extreme event*. 

   *  We need a climate data product that represents extreme events.

**Approach:**

We will follow a **storyline approach** ("physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways", `Shepherd et al. 2018 <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2317-9>`_), where we seek to understand the driving factors of a particular event and how changes in those factors may alter impacts. We focus on a particular extreme event (Hurricane Irene) and simulate how that event changes under a warmer climate. Since we will be relying on computationally intense impact models, we will follow a more deterministic approach and run a small subset of high-fidelity simulations. We opt for a **dynamical climate downscaling approach** to ensure the extreme precipitation event is well-represented at high spatial and temporal resolution needed for flood impact modeling. Given our storyline focus and desire to do a direct comparison to a simulated event under different global climates (historical and future GHG emissions), we use a **"Pseudo-Global Warming" approach** (`Sch√§r et al. 1996 <https://doi.org/10.1029/96GL00265>`_) to introduce the future climate anomaly to our historical hurricane event simulation to focus on changes in coastal and hydrologic responses due to climate warming.
