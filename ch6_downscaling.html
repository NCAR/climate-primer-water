<section id="introduction">
<h2>6.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Despite continuing improvements in Global Climate Models (GCMs) and
computational capabilities of high-performance computers, the spatial
resolution of the current suite of GCMs is typically too coarse for
use in project-specific applications. For example, the spatial
resolution of the GCMs included in the most recent Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) ranged from
approximately 0.5 degree to 4 degrees in horizontal resolution or
approximately 50 km to 400 km (Andrews et al. 2012; Taylor et al.,
2012). To overcome resolution issues, downscaling is a common approach
to translating climate change signals represented by climate models to
changes in meteorological parameters at the regional and local scales
(Gutmann et al. 2014; Kotamarthi et al. 2021). Downscaling bridges the
gap between the coarse resolution of climate models and the finer scales
needed for impact assessments that assess water resources, agriculture,
ecosystems, and other sectors. An example of this discrepancy is
highlighted in Figure 1, which compares simulated precipitation results
from a coarse resolution GCM against a high resolution regional model,
where it is evident that the high resolution model is capable of
resolving important meteorological processes resulting in a much more
realistic characterization of precipitation (source: Gutmann, personal
communication, NSF NCAR).</p>
<p>Downscaling uses techniques aimed at enhancing the spatial and
temporal resolution of data obtained from GCMs and is generally
considered necessary in hydrologic analysis, which benefits from
high-resolution climate data, with scales of a few kilometers at most
and at daily or even hourly timescales (Bhuvandas et al. 2014;
Vogel et al. 2023). Downscaling techniques are broadly categorized into
two main types: statistical and dynamical, although there are many
examples where techniques are blended together to improve the
performance of regional climate information (Jang and Kavvas 2015; Le
Roux et al. 2019; Vandal et al 2019; Hobeichi et al. 2023). Machine
learning methods are also becoming more prevalent and promising as an
efficient and cost effective approach to downscaling (Jebeile 2021;
Hobeichi et al. 2023).</p>
<p>While each method has its pros and cons, it’s important to recognize
that while these methods can enhance local scale details based on the
coarser scale GCM data, they cannot influence the larger scale dynamics
that actually occur in the climate system. However, new generations of
climate models are addressing this issue, with some GCMs run at 5
k resolution globally, and a new generation of variable
resolution models (Huang et al 2016; Rhoades et al. 2018) employing
unstructured grids, which allows for high resolution in places of
interest (e.g., the Sierra or Rocky Mountains) and lower resolution where
detailed fields are not needed (i.e., the Oceans). These more recent
methods are still being developed within the research community
and their practical applications are limited to date. Given that it
takes considerable effort to develop high-quality, useful climate
datasets, practitioners have made use of datasets
developed by the climate science community, with data distributions
made available through accessible data portals.</p>

<h2>6.2 Approaches to downscaling<a class="headerlink" href="#approaches-to-downscaling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are a multitude of techniques for translating coarse resolution
GCM into fine-scale, local meteorological data useful for
hydrologic modeling and analysis. Figure 5.1 provides a general summary
of the approaches to downscaling, suggesting a ranking of methods from
the ‘simpler’ approaches to the left and to the more complex and
computationally intensive approaches to the right (Teutschbein and
Seibert 2012; Vandal et al. 2019). While the figure suggests a given
downscaling procedure will result in a usable dataset, the reality is
that the various methods can include various combinations of approaches.
The bottom line: There is some “art” to downscaling; there is no one single
approach, and often the various methods are combined or blended based on
the needs of the study.</p>
<p>From the figure, downscaling techniques include fairly simple “Delta
Change” methods, to more sophisticated statistical methods that
increasingly make use of machine learning, and dynamical methods, which
use physical/process based models of the earth system (e.g., the
atmosphere, ocean, land). Statistical downscaling uses statistical or
mathematical relationships to refine coarse GCM output to a finer scale,
while dynamical downscaling employs more physically based regional
climate models to resolve finer-scale features. These regional models
use the GCM output as boundary conditions to enhance resolution over
smaller spatial domains.</p>
<p>Recent developments in machine learning have introduced new methods that
blend some of the benefits and drawbacks of both statistical and
dynamical approaches (Vandal et al. 2019). These techniques are
applicable for enhancing both spatial and temporal resolution. In
statistical methods, the modifications to spatial and temporal data can
usually be handled separately, while dynamical downscaling allows for a
flexible temporal resolution, because RCMs simulate the full
3-dimensional atmosphere that conserves mass, energy, and momentum and
represents the energy and moisture budgets, with model time steps
typically less than 1 minute. Statistical downscaling is typically not
computationally expensive nor does it typically require large amounts of
computing power or data storage, while dynamically downscaling typically
requires High Performance Computing (HPC), which is both computationally
and data intensive.</p>
<p>The Dynamical Downscaling approaches include the Pseudo Global Warming
(PGW), which modifies historic meteorological data, such as the ERA5.
PGW is similar to the statistical delta change approach, in that it
maintains the same weather patterns; however, the dynamical model is
able to resolve physical feedbacks in the climate system (e.g., convection). Even with dynamical downscaling,
Bias Correction (BC) is often still applied after the generation of the
meteorological dataset.</p>

<p>Figure 1. A summary of the various downscaling methods and their general
characteristics, from the simpler Delta Change approach on the left, to
non-parametric methods that rely on high-quality, long observational
records; parametric methods that create statistical relationships
between GCMs and surface variables (e.g daily precipitation and
temperature), where the simple linear equation is used to imply the
estimation of parameters (i.e. <em>m,b)</em>; Pseudo Global Warming (PGW);
Bias-Correction (BC), Variable Resolution Global Climate Model (VRGCM).</p>
<section id="statistical-downscaling">
<h3>6.2.1 Statistical Downscaling<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-downscaling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Statistical downscaling techniques can be employed to enhance both the
temporal and spatial resolution of data, making it more applicable for
hydrologic modeling applications. For hydrologic applications, the
target variables are most often - daily Precipitation, Maximum and
Minimum Temperature, sometimes Maximum and Minimum Relative Humidity,
Windspeed, and Solar Radiation. Commonly, these are at a daily timestep,
with some datasets available sub-daily.</p>
<p>There are various statistical methods available, each utilizing
statistical relationships between broad-scale climate variables from
General Circulation Models (GCMs) and observed local climate data to
create finely tuned projections for specific areas. For instance, one
might use high-resolution observed data and average it across the
coarser grid squares of a GCM. On days when temperature and humidity in
the observed, coarse data match those in the GCM data, it can be assumed
that the high-resolution temperature and precipitation patterns for that
day in the GCM will mirror those of the similar days in the observed
data. Statistical downscaling methods include Delta Change (or change
factor [morea about this below]) methods, regression techniques, weather generators, and weather
classification strategies (Ekstrom et al., 2015). Each method has its
own set of strengths and weaknesses, as detailed in Table 1. A
generalized tool for evaluating and generating regional climate
projections using a variety of statistical techniques has been developed
by Gutmann et al. 2022, and available at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NCAR/GARD">https://github.com/NCAR/GARD</a>.</p>
<p><em>Some advantages and disadvantages of statistical are as follows.</em></p>
<p>Statistical downscaling depends on the availability and quality of
historical observational data for calibration. In regions with limited
or poor-quality historical data, statistical downscaling might be
limited. ​Generally, the statistical downscaling methods create relationships between
historically observed climate and climate simulations from GCM output,
with the assumption that the historical relationships will hold into the
future. It is not clear that any statistical downscaling method can be relied on to represent changes in atmospheric phenomena that most GCMs do not simulate in the
first place, such as major tropical cyclones and hurricanes.</p>
<section id="delta-change-methods">
<h4>Delta Change Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#delta-change-methods" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>A simple, but informative method to explore climate change sensitivity
of hydrologic systems is referred to as the “Delta Change” approach. It
starts by exploring the observational record of climate variables like
temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and others. This dataset
represents the “baseline” or reference period. Then change factors are
derived from global climate models, providing projections of how these
climate variables might change in the future under various greenhouse
gas concentration scenarios.</p>
<p>Delta-change factors are derived as the difference between the future
climate projections of the GCMs against a historical baseline (usually
averages over a specified reference period). For precipitation a ratio
is typically used instead of a difference. These differences, or deltas,
are typically expressed in terms of changes in mean temperature, precipitation
amounts, etc., then applied to the historical data to build custom datasets. For example, if the delta for temperature is a +2°C
increase, this change is added to the historical temperature records to
generate a “future” dataset. A widely used method that employs the
delta-change method has been promoted by the World Bank known as
Decision Scaling (Brown et al. 2016). It uses a stress test approach
to identify system vulnerabilities, and simple, direct techniques for
the implementation of climate projections, such as the use of weather generators and delta-change that are informed by GCM results.</p>
</section>
<section id="non-parametric-methods">
<h4>Non-Parametric Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#non-parametric-methods" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In the context of downscaling global climate models (GCMs),
“non-parametric” downscaling refers to statistical approaches that do
not make assumptions about the underlying probability distributions of
the variables involved. Instead, they use more flexible statistical
techniques that can capture complex, nonlinear relationships between
variables. Resampling techniques include bootstrap resampling or Monte
Carlo resampling methods that can be used to generate ensemble datasets
to represent uncertainty in the downscaling process without relying on
specific parametric assumptions</p>
<p>Non-parametric downscaling methods offer advantages in capturing complex
relationships and handling non-linearities in the climate system, which
may be particularly important when downscaling GCM outputs to local or
regional scales where these relationships can be highly variable.
However, they may also require serially complete, spatially dense, and
long-length datasets, and can be more computationally demanding than
parametric methods.</p>
<p>Some of the more common Non-Parametric techniques include the following.</p>
<p><strong>The Locally Constructed Analog (LOCA) method</strong>,  constructs
local analogs by identifying days in the historical observational
record with similar large-scale climate patterns to those simulated
by the climate model. The selected analogs are weighted based on
their similarity to the target pattern and then interpolated to the
desired observational grid.Focuses on single-variable analogs, with a
primary emphasis on spatial patterns and high-resolution consistency
with observations (Pierce et al. 2016).</p>
<p><strong>The Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA</strong>) downscaling
method identifies analog days in the historical record that closely
match the multivariate climate conditions of each day in the GCM
simulations. These analogs are selected based on multiple climate
variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to ensure a
comprehensive representation of climate conditions. Once the analog
days are identified, their observed weather patterns are used to
construct a high-resolution climate dataset corresponding to the GCM
projections. This involves combining the observed data from the
analog days with the simulated data to generate downscaled outputs.
MACA is considered “adaptive” as it allows for the ability to adjust
the selection of analog days over time and space, ensuring that the
downscaling remains relevant as climate conditions evolve. The
primary difference between MACA and LOCA is that MACA uses a
multivariate approach to downscaling, considering multiple climate
variables simultaneously to construct analogs (Abatzoglou et
al. 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Machine-learning approaches</strong> such as support vector machines, random
forests (He et al. 2016), neural networks, and kernel-based methods can
be used to learn the relationship between large-scale and local-scale
climate variables from historical data without assuming a specific
functional form. A Machine Learning method by Benton et al. (2022)
demonstrates how a neural network can be used to generate high spatial-
and temporal-resolution wind and solar data from GCMs (Creswell et al.
2018). The approach uses generative adversarial networks or (GANs),
which are trained on observed wind and solar data at 4-km hourly
resolution against the same meteorological fields at 100-km resolution
to learn the relationship between these variables across spatial scales.
The model is then applied to downscale 100-km daily GCM output to 4 km
hourly resolution, with the assumption that the relationships are the
same in observational and GCM data, and will hold into the future
(Buster et al 2024; Kochkov et al. 2024).</p>
<p><strong>The Bias-Correction-Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD)</strong> is a well
established method of statistical downscaling, whereby climate model
outputs are corrected for systematic biases compared to observed data,
which are then spatially interpolated to a finer grid. The bias
correction usually entails quantifying the difference between the model
output and observed data, often using quantile mapping, which matches
the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the model data with the
observations. Spatial interpolation methods such as (eg. bilinear
interpolation, nearest-neighbor interpolation) are then applied to the
bias-corrected data at the GCM scale to a finer grid.</p>
<p><strong>The K Nearest Neighbor algorithm</strong>, The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)
method is another statistical downscaling technique used to refine
coarse-resolution climate model outputs to finer spatial resolutions.
This approach relies on the similarity between observed and modeled data
patterns to generate high-resolution climate projections. A unique
aspect of K-NN is its ability to craft scenario “narratives” that are
conditioned off of particular attributes of a GCM, such as drier and
warmer, or “much drier and warmer” types of scenarios (Yates et al.
2005; Seyyed et al. 2012).</p>

<section id="parametric-methods">
<h4>Parametric Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#parametric-methods" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Parametric statistical downscaling employs statistical models that
assume a specific functional form or distribution for the relationship
between large-scale climate variables (predictors) and local-scale
climate variables (predictands). These methods are called “parametric”
because they involve fitting parameters of a predefined statistical
model to the data. The parameters of the statistical model establish the
relationship between large-scale climate variables (such as 500-millibar
height, vertically integrated moisture, etc.) simulated by GCMs and
local-scale climate variables at the downscale level (such as
temperature and precipitation at specific locations). These parametric
methods typically involve fitting regression models, such as linear
regression or multiple linear regression, to historical climate data to
establish the relationship between large-scale and local-scale
variables.</p>
<p>A well established, statistical downscaling approach has been developed
by Rob Wilby (Wilby 2004). Known as the Statistical DownScaling Model,
SDSM is a climate scenario generation tool that uses a multiple linear
regression technique to establish statistical relationships between
large-scale predictors (such as those from GCMs) and local climate
variables such as daily precipitation and temperature (predictands). The
tool is available online, well documented in terms of understanding and
implementation, and can be freely downloaded from the SDSM website
(<a class="reference external" href="https://sdsm.org.uk/">https://sdsm.org.uk/</a>). SDSM has been used globally for various
applications, including water-resource management, flood-risk
assessment, and urban climate studies​.</p>

<h3>6.2.2 Dynamical Downscaling<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamical-downscaling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Dynamical downscaling involves the combined use of both global and
regional climate models (RCMs) to achieve higher spatial resolution and
in some cases temporal resolution, over specific geographic areas.
Traditionally, RCMs ingest outputs from GCMs as boundary
conditions—assuming GCM data to be accurate at the edges of the RCM’s
domain—and provide more detailed regional climate information. While
RCMs can be applied to any location, their high-resolution design makes
them computationally intensive, typically limiting their application to
regions a few thousand kilometers on a side, given sufficient resources.
RCMs offer enhanced flexibility in variable outputs and maintain more
physically consistent results. However, RCM-downscaled outputs can
retain biases from the GCM inputs and may introduce additional
uncertainties. This reality means that RCM inputs are frequently bias
corrected before running the RCM, and RCM outputs commonly require an
additional post-processing step typically in the form of a bias
correction. Nevertheless, RCMs can improve the representation of
fine-scale weather variability influenced by local or micro-climate
conditions, which are crucial for understanding extreme weather events
that impact hydrologic systems.</p>

<p class="sd-card-text"><em>The Weather Research Forecast Model (WRF)</em> - The WRF model is one of
the most widely used dynamical downscaling tools available for
conducting Regional Climate Modeling experiments. The WRF model is a
state of the art mesoscale numerical weather prediction system
designed for both atmospheric research, operational forecasting
applications, and more recently, regional climate-change projection
development, where it is used to downscale ESM outputs to a finer
resolution, typically on the order of a few kilometers, to study
regional climate features. This process allows for more detailed
simulations of local climate processes that GCMs might miss due to
their coarser grid resolutions.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">The WRF model serves a wide range of meteorological applications
across scales from tens of meters to thousands of kilometers. The
effort to develop WRF began in the latter 1990s and was a
collaborative partnership of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(represented by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
(NCEP) and the Earth System Research Laboratory), the U.S. Air Force,
the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Oklahoma, and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">WRF can produce simulations based on actual
atmospheric conditions (i.e., from observations and analyses),
idealized conditions, and future climate projections driven by ESMs.
WRF offers operational forecasting a flexible and
computationally efficient platform, while reflecting recent advances
in physics, numerics, and data assimilation contributed by developers
from the expansive research community. WRF is currently in
operational use at NCEP and other national meteorological centers as
well as in real-time forecasting configurations at laboratories,
universities, and companies. WRF has a large worldwide community of
registered users (a cumulative total of over 57,800 in over 160
countries as of 2021), and NCAR provides regular workshops and
tutorials on its use.</p>

</details><p>Similar to statistical downscaling, many institutions provide publicly
available dynamically downscaled products. However, these products often
have limitations on the number of years, scenarios, regions, and
variables they cover. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling
Experiment (CORDEX) produced such products, designed to evaluate
regional climate-model performance through a series of experiments,
including generating regional climate projections (Giorgi &amp; Gutowski
2015). Over North America, the NA-CORDEX archive includes many
dynamically downscaled projections (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.na-cordex.org">http://www.na-cordex.org</a>). Although
CORDEX data are readily accessible, its primary focus on model
intercomparison means that other dynamically downscaled products might
be better suited for specific regions and applications. In addition,
CORDEX data have historically been relatively coarse in spatial
resolution (&gt;= 25 km) and have not included a bias correction of the
global model data, and thus are not well suited for regional hydrologic
applications, where spatial gradients and their influence on weather and
climate are critical to represent.</p>

<h4>Intermediate Complexity Models<a class="headerlink" href="#intermediate-complexity-models" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Fully dynamical Global and Regional Climate models are expensive to run,
because they require substantial computation for simulating both
past and future climate. A novel alternative to the full physics models
is what is known as the suite of intermediate complexity models. One such model is
NSF NCAR’s Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research (ICAR) model
which is a simplified atmospheric model designed primarily for climate
downscaling and atmospheric sensitivity testing (Gutmann et al. 2016).
ICAR is a quasi-dynamical downscaling approach that uses simplified wind
dynamics to perform high-resolution meteorological simulations 100 to
1000 times faster than a traditional atmospheric model and can therefore
be used to better characterize uncertainty across numerical weather
prediction models and climate models, and in dynamical downscaling
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NCAR/icar">https://github.com/NCAR/icar</a>).</p>

<section id="pseudo-global-warming">
<h4>Pseudo Global Warming<a class="headerlink" href="#pseudo-global-warming" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The PGW approach involves modifying historical weather data with future
climate-change signals derived from global climate models (GCMs) to
simulate specific weather events to represent future climate conditions.
This method allows researchers to isolate the influence of climate change
on weather events by comparing the outcomes of the modified
(pseudo-warmed) simulations against the original historical data with a
shorter simulation time period. However, this method does not permit the
model to project changes in the frequency of large-scale weather
patterns such as atmospheric rivers or tropical cyclones. The PGW
approach can be considered a type of “narrative, what-if, or storyline”
approach, where the climate of the past is assumed to repeat in the
future, but the meteorological fields are perturbed to reflect, for
example, a “warmer and moister environment” (Rhoades et al. 2023). Some
recently innovated tools that can be used to develop PGW datasets are available,
such as those from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Potopoles/PGW4ERA5">Brogli et al. (2023)</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a PGW dataset, which has been developed as a collaboration
between NCAR and USGS Water Mission Area is the CONUS404 (Rasmussen et
al. 2023); a unique, high-resolution hydro-climate dataset appropriate
for forcing hydrological models and conducting meteorological analysis
over the conterminous United States. CONUS404, so named because it
covers the CONterminous United States for over 40 years at 4-km
resolution, was produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
model simulations run by NCAR. The CONUS404 includes 42 years of data
(water years 1980-2021) and the spatial domain extends into Canada and
Mexico, thereby capturing transboundary river basins and covering all
contributing areas for CONUS surface waters.</p>

<p>A new generation of global climate models takes advantage of a refined
mesh that enhances the model’s ability to simulate climate processes
with greater detail and accuracy in regions of interest while
maintaining computational efficiency relative to running the entire
globe at the higher resolution. This approach allows the model to focus
computational resources on specific areas, such as coastlines,
mountainous regions, or areas prone to extreme weather, without
excessively increasing the overall computational cost.</p>
<p>An example of such a model is the U.S. Department of Energy’s, Energy
Exascale Earth System Model ([E3SM] Zhang et al. 2024) model, a
state-of-the-art Earth system model designed to run on exascale
supercomputers. The E3SM model integrates components of the
Earth system, including the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land, to
provide a comprehensive understanding of climate interactions and
feedbacks.</p>

<h3>6.2.4 Pre- and Post- Processing of Climate Models<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-and-post-processing-of-climate-models" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<section id="bias-correction">
<h4>Bias Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#bias-correction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>A reality of both GCMs and RCMs is that both are prone to
biases due to our limited ability to represent the true state of the
climate system because our representation of model physics,
parameterizations and initial conditions are imperfect. These biases
can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the downscaled
climate projections. To address this, bias-correction techniques are
often employed (Teutschbein and Seibert 2012; Mendez et al. 2020). Bias
correction involves adjusting the model outputs to better match observed
data. There are two primary stages at which bias correction can be
applied: pre-bias correction and post-bias correction.</p>
<p>While dynamical downscaling with regional climate models (RCMs) helps
refine the coarse resolution outputs of GCMs, both GCMs and RCMs are
prone to biases due to imperfections in model physics,
parameterizations, and initial conditions. These biases can
significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the downscaled
climate projections. Additionally, if a hydrologic model is calibrated
against an observed meteorological dataset, then the climate model
outputs should contain similar statistical attributes, To address this,
bias correction techniques are employed. Bias correction involves
adjusting the model outputs to better match observed data. There are two
primary stages at which bias correction can be applied: pre-bias
correction and post-bias correction.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-bias correction is applied before the dynamical downscaling
process</strong>. This involves adjusting the outputs of the GCMs before they
are used as boundary conditions for the RCMs. The advantage of pre-bias
correction is that it ensures the inputs fed into the RCMs are already
adjusted for biases, which can lead to more accurate boundary conditions
and potentially more accurate downscaled outputs. This method helps align the large-scale drivers with observed data, which can be
particularly beneficial in regions where the RCMs’ performance is highly
sensitive to the accuracy of the boundary conditions. For example, many
GCMs have too much moisture along the west coast of North America. This
results in RCM simulations with snowpacks that are too deep, and as a
result, the snow albedo feedback effect is not simulated correctly, and
the degree to which it affects future air temperature changes is a
function of the bias in the GCM rather than to the true physical
processes (Kim et al. 2020). However, a modest bias correction to the
boundary conditions dramatically improves this representation and
decreases the spread of future projected changes in air temperature. In
other regions, GCM biases have been shown to significantly inhibit the
formation of tropical cyclones, as such the changes in tropical cyclones
can not be simulated accurately without removing the large scale biases
in wind shear and atmospheric stability (Akhter et al. 2023).</p>
<p><strong>Post-bias correction is applied after the dynamical downscaling
process</strong>. This method adjusts the outputs of the GCNs and
RCMs to match observed data. The main advantage of post-bias correction
is that it directly targets the biases in the high-resolution climate
projections produced by the GCMs and RCMs (Chen et al. 2021). This
approach allows for the correction of biases introduced at both the GCM
and RCM stages. Post-bias correction can be more flexible and targeted,
as it deals directly with the final outputs used for impact
studies and decision-making. Many end-users of climate-change data will
compare the observed climate to the modeled climate without
removing biases. Such comparisons reveal the bias in the model instead
of the changes of interest. Similarly, threshold-dependent metrics (e.g.,
the number of days with a heat index greater than 100°F) are extremely
sensitive to small biases in the underlying dataset. Finally, if there
is a need to run impact models, such as hydrologic modes which are often
carefully calibrated to a given observational dataset, it is
important to bias-correct the downscaled data to retain the
underlying statistical properties to maintain consistency with the
hydrologic model calibration. A common approach to bias correction is
quantile mapping, which is a statistical technique used to correct
biases in climate model output by aligning the statistical distribution
of model-simulated variables with observed data. The approach involves
the following steps.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs): The CDF of the climate
model output is compared to the CDF of the observational data for a
particular variable (e.g., temperature, precipitation) over a
historical period.</p></li>
<li><p>Mapping: A mapping function is created that adjusts the model outputs
so that their CDF matches the CDF of the observations. This mapping
can be applied to model projections to correct biases in future
climate scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>Application: The correction is applied to future climate-model
simulations by transforming the model outputs using the mapping
function derived from the historical period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is particularly effective in addressing systematic biases
in climate models, especially for extreme values, by ensuring that the
corrected model outputs better represent the observed climate
distribution.</p>
<p>In summary, both pre- and post-bias correction techniques are essential
for improving the reliability of downscaled climate projections.
Pre-bias correction ensures that the inputs to RCMs are more accurate,
potentially enhancing the overall downscaling process. Post-bias
correction directly addresses the biases in the final high-resolution
outputs, ensuring that the downscaled projections are more aligned with
observed data. The choice between pre- and post-bias correction, or a
combination of both, depends on the specific requirements of the study
and the characteristics of the region and models being used.</p>
