  <p>Ch3.2 Baseline natural variability and detection and attribution of
observed changes</p>
<p>This section provided an introduction to ways to understand and quantify
the baseline or climate starting point of the study area of interest,
and the natural variability of the system itself, outside of its
evolution under climate change impacts, as well as how to define changes
that have already been occurring due to climate change. We start with a
brief overview of what these different types of variability are, where
they have already been observed, then discuss methods that can be more
generally applied to a particular region to discern these different
types of variability.</p>
<p>As background, the pop-out below provides background information on the
Earth’s energy balance, the factors that influence it, and thus lead to
climate variability and change.</p>
<p>— start popout Ch3.2 Earth’s energy balance and the greenhouse effect</p>
<section id="earths-energy-balance-and-the-greenhouse-effect">
<h1><strong>Earth’s Energy Balance and the Greenhouse Effect</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#earths-energy-balance-and-the-greenhouse-effect" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image16.jpg"><img alt="still" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image16.jpg" style="width: 6.5in; height: 3.65278in;" /></a></p>
<p>The Earth is in a delicate equilibrium of solar energy (mainly shortwave
ultraviolet) coming in and longwave energy (mainly infrared) going out.
Slight alterations to this balance impact weather and climate. These can
be caused by the natural cycles of climate variability, such as volcanic
eruptions, that temporarily reduce the amount of solar energy reaching
the Earth’s surface, thus disrupting the energy balance.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image30.jpg"><img alt="Volcanic eruption" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image30.jpg" style="width: 6.5in; height: 4.875in;" /></a></p>
<p>Small changes to the balance of energy between the Sun and Earth are
driving recent trends in global temperature.</p>
<p>The diagram below of the energy cycle shows the amount of energy, in
Watts per square meter, that comes into the Earth-atmosphere-ocean
system, stays within it, and leaves. Notice that about one third of the
342 W/m2 of solar energy (the yellow arrows) is reflected back to space
by the atmosphere or surface, while about two thirds is absorbed. As
we’ve seen, the magnitude of solar energy reflected by aerosols
sometimes increases temporarily after major volcanic eruptions, leading
to temporary decreases in solar energy reaching Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>On the right side of the diagram, the red arrows show the amount of
terrestrial energy (mainly infrared) emitted by the Earth’s surface and
atmosphere. Some is radiated back to space. But due to the presence of
greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and water vapor in particular, a
significant portion is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-radiated back
to Earth. The “Back Radiation” portion of the diagram shows the heat
energy radiated from the atmosphere to the surface. This is the
<strong>Greenhouse Effect</strong>. Without naturally occurring greenhouse gases, the
Earth would be an inhospitably cold and frozen planet.</p>

<h1><strong>Natural Climate Variability versus Climate Change</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#natural-climate-variability-versus-climate-change" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image13.jpg"><img alt="Ice core from Antarctica" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image13.jpg" style="width: 6.25in; height: 4.58333in;" /></a></p>
<p>Scientists have explored past global temperature trends using proxy
data—tree rings, ice cores, etc.—that show the Earth has had numerous
and somewhat irregular swings in temperature over the past several
hundred thousand years. Those swings in temperature contribute to
variations in other natural phenomena such as streamflow.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image9.jpg"><img alt="Map of Colorado River Basin." src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image9.jpg" style="width: 6.25in; height: 4.58333in;" /></a></p>
<p>To take one example, tree ring analysis can be used to reconstruct
streamflow in the rivers of the western United States. This has been
done for rivers such as the Colorado River at Lee’s Ferry, in the state
of Arizona.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image4.jpg"><img alt="A reconstruction of streamflow for the Colorado River at Lees Ferry based on tree ring data." src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image4.jpg" style="width: 6.25in; height: 3.65278in;" /></a></p>
<p>The reconstructed streamflow shows large swings in annual streamflow
volume on the Colorado River. Multi-year periods of wet and dry can be
seen in the 25-year running mean of the annual streamflow.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image40.jpg"><img alt="Graph of temperatures and CO2 concentrations for the past 800,000 years" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image40.jpg" style="width: 6.45833in; height: 3.59722in;" /></a></p>
<p>Ice cores, on the other hand, can provide a depiction of changes in
global temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> levels over the past several hundred
thousand years. This graphic shows that warmer periods coincide with
higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide levels have naturally fluctuated between 180 parts per
million (ppm) and 280 ppm. This is an example of a naturally occurring
climate forcing. Human industrialization has been a major source of the
increase in CO<sub>2</sub> in the most recent century, with average annual
concentrations exceeding 420 ppm in 2024. This is an example of
anthropogenic forcing. We can see how carbon dioxide concentration has
continued to rise over the last decade, as seen in the black line in the
figure below.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image45.jpg"><img alt="Red line shows annual fluctuation in CO2 Concentration from 2012-2016. Black line shows the smoothed upward trend." src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image45.jpg" style="width: 6.5in; height: 5.01389in;" /></a></p>
<p>Trajectories of past global mean temperatures have been estimated using
experiments conducted with Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models
(AOGCMs). Experiments that do not incorporate anthropogenic forcing
produce the trajectory shown with the blue line and the light blue
uncertainty bounds in the figure below.</p>
<p>The black line shows the observed global mean temperatures. You can see
that the experiments that do not include anthropogenic forcings fail to
reproduce the warming that has been observed over the past half century.</p>
<p>Experiments were also run that do include anthropogenic forcings. This
trajectory is shown with the red line and pink uncertainty bounds. You
can see that when anthropogenic forcings are included, the global
climate models do produce results that very closely match the observed
warming trends. This suggests that anthropogenic factors have emerged as
a significant contributor to global warming.</p>

<p><strong>Climate variability</strong></p>
<p>When accounting for climate change impacts on research in water and
environmental studies, it is important to differentiate between climate
variability, for which the past can be a guide, and climate change,
where the past is not necessarily a good predictor as climate change
involves changes to this natural variability. Starting off this section,
we will review some of the natural climate cycles and occurrences.</p>
<p><a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">:mark:`– start popout Ch3.2 Regular climate cycle`</span></a></p>

<section id="regular-climate-cycle">
<h1><strong>Regular Climate Cycle</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#regular-climate-cycle" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>

<p>The most regular climate cycle is the change of seasons. The seasons
determine the times of year when precipitation may be most abundant,
evapotranspiration will peak, tropical cyclones are most likely to form,
and snowpack accumulates and melts. Although the change of seasons is
very dependable, there is often year-to-year variation.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image39.jpg"><img alt="before" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image39.jpg" style="width: 5.17188in; height: 5.72399in;" /></a><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image19.jpg"><img alt="after" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image19.jpg" style="width: 5.58333in; height: 5.60938in;" /></a></p>
<p>To illustrate natural season-to-season variability, here we see
differences in snowpack on the first of April in two consecutive years.
The 2011 analysis shows large areas with above average snowpack in the
central Rocky Mountain region and California Sierra Nevada Range in the
United States. In 2012, these same areas had abnormally low snowpack,
reflecting a less productive snow season. Good research planning allows
for such variation. But will the expected range of snowpack change as
the climate warms?</p>
<p><a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">:mark:`– stop popout Ch3.2 Regular climate cycle`</span></a></p>
<p>When speaking of climate change, we are referring to changes in average
weather conditions that persist over multiple decades or longer. Climate
change encompasses both increases and decreases in temperature, as well
as shifts in precipitation, changes in frequency and location of severe
weather events, and changes to other features of the climate system.The
principal natural drivers of climate change (which are also termed
external natural forcings), include changes in incoming solar radiation
(through solar cycles), volc:mark:<cite>anic activity, orbital cycles, and
changes in global biogeochemical cycles.</cite></p>

<p>Major volcanic eruptions are irregular natural climate events. In this
global temperature time series, we can see how the sun-shielding
properties of atmospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions result in
decreased global average temperatures. Notice how Mt. Pinatubo’s 1991
eruption decreased global average temperatures for 1-2 years.</p>

<p>There are much longer climate variability cycles associated with changes
in the Earth’s orbital eccentricity and its tilt with respect to the
Sun.</p>

<p>These cycles, known as the Milankovitch Cycles, lead to big changes in
the amount and distribution of solar energy on the Earth’s surface. The
global temperature during these long-duration cycles ranges from being
much colder (the ice ages) to much warmer than the current global
average temperature.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image40.jpg"><img alt="Graph of temperatures and CO2 concentrations for the past 800,000 years" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image40.jpg" style="width: 6.45833in; height: 3.59722in;" /></a></p>
<p>Milankovitch Cycles unfold on timescales much longer than a human life
span, from tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The rate of change
associated with the Milankovitch Cycles is so slow that it will not
impact water research planning for the next century or so.</p>

<p>Albedo is a measure of how well a surface can reflect solar energy.
Reflective surfaces, like snow, ice, and clouds, have high albedo and
are efficient at reflecting solar energy back to space. In the satellite
images centered on the Sierra Nevada, snow and clouds have very high
albedo and appear white. You can see that there may be large
year-to-year differences in snow cover and thus the albedo. Even desert
sands have high albedo and show up as relatively bright in this visible
satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Dark colored surfaces have low albedo and absorb solar energy. This
impacts the solar energy absorbed by Earth. Forest areas appear dark on
visible satellite images, and are more efficient at absorbing solar
energy. Bodies of water appear very dark and have very low albedos.</p>

<p><a href="#id53"><span class="problematic" id="id54">:mark:`In addition to these secular changes to the climate, there is
also variability that originates from natural processes within the
coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land-biosphere system that is
generally termed internally generated variability, arising primarily
from the uneven distribution of energy across the planet at any given
time (Lehner and Deser, 2023). A primary source of internal variability
is the atmospheric general circulation with its day-to-day and
week-to-week weather fluctuations with limits to their predictability
past a couple of weeks, and can be termed random- or stochastic
processes past those limits. In general, the climate system is highly
variable at regional scales, and that such internally-generated
variability is irregular in time and carries limited predictability.
Processes arising from the coupling between the ocean and atmosphere are
also important sources of internally generated variability that give
rise to distinctive patterns (or “modes”) of variability on interannual
and longer timescales (Deser and Phillips, 2023). Examples include the
interannual events of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO); and the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO) patterns which can influence regional climate
conditions, such as droughts or cooling periods. It is a central
scientific challenge to identify anthropogenic influences on weather and
climate amidst this background of internal variability (Deser et al.,
2020).`</span></a></p>

<p>Recurring, but less regular, climate cycles often have a large influence

<p>A well known, semi-regular climate cycle is associated with the El Niño
Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO can have a significant impact on
precipitation and temperature in many regions of the world in a cycle
that recurs roughly every 3-4 years.</p>
<p>In the contiguous United States, the ENSO cycle can have large
influences on precipitation distribution, especially in the cool season.</p>
<p>Below we see the typical impacts of El Niño versus La Niña on both the
sea surface temperature anomalies of the tropical Pacific Ocean, and the
November through March precipitation in the contiguous United States.
The difference can be very important for snowpack and the potential for
regional floods and drought. There are differences from one cycle to the
next, but these composite maps provide guidance based on historic data.
Note that La Niña typically results in a drier winter across a broader
area than El Niño.</p>

the global mean annual temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2014. An
“anomaly” is simply the departure of a temperature from a baseline, in

temperature for today is 15°C but the actual temperature is 18°C, then
the temperature anomaly is +3°C. If the actual temperature was 12°C,
then the anomaly would be -3°C. In these two times series, the anomalies
are based on the 30-year average from 1951-1980. Therefore, the
anomalies show the departure of each average annual temperature from
that 30-year average. The red line represents the trend for the entire

temperature. For example, the decade of 1941-1950 shows distinct
cooling, while the overlapping decade of 1933-1942 shows very distinct
warming. Since the mid-20th century, 10-year temperature trends are
mainly warming, although there are flat periods as well as year-to-year

driver. However, this trend stopped once the United States and other
countries began to lower sulfur emissions in the 1970s to reduce acid
rain and respiratory illnesses (since 1975, the average global
temperature has risen by about 0.15-0.2°C per decade). This observed
cooling effect is one reason why the injection of sulfate aerosols into

Change (NAS, 2016)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Detection –</em> Detection and attribution are two important concepts in
the field of climate science, particularly when studying climate change.
Detection refers to the process of demonstrating that some aspect of
climate has changed in some statistical sense, without providing a
reason for that change. It is about identifying a significant change in
the climate system (temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, shifts in
seasonal cycles, etc.) that is above and beyond the natural internal
variability of the system. Detection does not imply understanding the
cause of changes; it’s about observing (or making a determination beyond
a level of significance) that a change has occurred, and provides the
basis for attributing these changes to specific causes, such as human
activities. Because of the presence of natural variability and other
noise in the data under study, distinguishing a climate-change induced
signal is more often a statistical process (e.g. a detectable observed
change is one which is determined to be highly unlikely to occur – say,
less than about a 10% chance – due to internal variability alone).</p>
<p>The popout below provides an overview of the changes in climate variable
statistical distributions that could result from climate change. In
context of detection, there are a variety of statistical tests that can
be used to test the significance of differences between distributions
(e.g. the Kolmorgorav-Smirnov two sample test that two data samples come
from the same distribution; NIST, 2023; Chakravart et al., 1967; Press
et al., 1992).</p>

<section id="climate-change-and-extremes">
<h1><strong>Climate Change and Extremes</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#climate-change-and-extremes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Just as changes in annual and seasonal mean temperature and
precipitation are very important to water research and resources,
depending on the particular focus of the planning, changes in short
duration extremes can be very important too. Extremes can have direct
impacts on habitat, and pose risks to infrastructure. It is important to
get a sense for what extremes represent from a statistical standpoint.
<a href="#id77"><span class="problematic" id="id78">:mark:`Extreme weather is a bit relative. For example, a hot day in
Wyoming would be considered a mild one in Arizona. And we don't
generally notice changes in climate because most weather falls within
the range of what is expected. It is mainly the extreme events that get
our attention—events that are outside our normal experience and that
often inflict human suffering. So how might global warming affect
climate extremes and extreme weather? There are several possible ways.`</span></a></p>
<p>Temperature at a given location can be roughly represented with a bell
curve or a normal distribution, similar to the top panel in the figure
below, <a href="#id79"><span class="problematic" id="id80">:mark:`with the majority of the observations in the middle,`</span></a> hot
and cold events in the tails of the curve, <a href="#id81"><span class="problematic" id="id82">:mark:`but with rare events
of extremely cold or extremely warm temperatures at the ends.`</span></a>
<a href="#id83"><span class="problematic" id="id84">:mark:`Global warming could shift the distribution to the right`</span></a> when
the average temperature increases. Temperatures that used to be
unusually high become more common, while heat levels not reached before
become more probable. Cold extremes still occur, but become less common.
Although not shown here, a:mark:<cite>nother possibility is that climate
change increases the variance (or width) in the distribution of
temperature—in other words, it increases the range of possibilities at
both ends of the distribution. Or climate change could result in a
combination of the two types of distributions. We don’t *a priori* know
exactly how the distributions of weather variables in each specific
location will be impacted.</cite></p>

<p>Precipitation curves have only one tail for the extreme precipitation
events, as shown in the bottom panel of the figure above <a href="#id85"><span class="problematic" id="id86">:mark:`(with
the two-parameter gamma traditionally used; Ye et al., 2018)`</span></a>. In a
warmer climate with more atmospheric water vapor, generally, more
intense precipitation events become more common. Recent observations
back this up, with high-end precipitation events becoming less rare than
they have been, in general.</p>
<p>– stop popout 3.2 Climate change and extremes</p>
<p><em>Attribution –</em> On the other hand, attribution deals with determining
the most likely causes for those detected changes in the climate. This
involves assessing the various natural and anthropogenic (human-induced)
factors that could have led to the observed changes, with these often
complex, interacting factors that can range in scales from molecular to
global, seconds to millennia. Attribution studies can use statistical
tests as well as climate models, to evaluate the relative contributions
of various causes to climate change (along with an assignment of
statistical confidence), like greenhouse gas emissions, solar radiation,
and volcanic activity, with the latter (coupled climate models) being an
especially powerful tool with potential to turn on and off factors in
controlled numerical simulations of the areas and events of interest. A
supporting concept is the idea of emergence of a climate change signal
or trend, referring to when a change in climate (the ‘signal’) becomes
larger than the amplitude of natural or internal variations (defining
the ‘noise’) (AR6). This concept is often expressed as a
‘signal-to-noise’ ratio (S/N) and emergence occurs at a defined
threshold of this ratio (e.g., S/N &gt;1 or 2) (Chen et al., 2021).</p>
<p><em>Elements of a Detection and Attribution Study –</em> The AR6 Cross-Working
Group Box on Attribution (Hope et al., 2021) provides a brief discussion
and figure (reproduced below), on <em>Steps towards an attribution
assessment</em>; and a similar discussion on four core elements to any
detection and attribution study is also provided in AR5 WG1 (Bindoff et
al., 2013: <em>10.2.1 The Context of Detection and Attribution</em>). Taken
together the following general steps are identified: a) the unambiguous
framing of what changes are being attributed to; b) clearly define the
indicators of the observed change or event, including observations of
one or more climate variables, such as surface temperature, that are
understood, on physical grounds, to be relevant to the process in
question, and note the quality of the observations; c) the
identification of the possible and plausible drivers of change,
including an estimate of how external drivers of climate change have
evolved before and during the period under investigation, including both
the driver whose influence is being investigated (such as rising
greenhouse gas levels) and potential confounding influences (such as
solar activity); d) the development of a hypothesis or theory for the
linkage with a quantitative physically based understanding, normally
encapsulated in a model, of how these external drivers are thought to
have affected these observed climate variables; e) and a system or
method to test the hypothesis or theory, typically including an
estimate, often but not always derived from a physically based model, of
the characteristics of variability expected in these observed climate
variables due to random, quasi-periodic and chaotic fluctuations
generated in the climate system that are not due to externally driven
climate change.</p>

<p><em>Attribution Methods –</em> Concerning the attribution methods or system to
test the hypothesis or theory, Bindoff et al. (2013) highlight that the
attribution of observed changes is not possible without some kind of
model of the relationship between external climate drivers and
observable variables given that we cannot observe a world in which
either anthropogenic or natural forcing is absent. Such models may be
very simple (e.g. a set of statistical assumptions) or very complex
(e.g. coupled Earth System Model), and that it is not necessary (or
possible) for them to be correct in all respects, but they must provide
a physically consistent representation of processes and scales relevant
to the attribution problem in question.</p>
<p>Some of the most powerful tools in the attribution process are models of
the system of interest that use “what if” approaches to isolate the
impacts of anthropogenic (and other) factors that are hypothesized to be
driving the changes in the observed record. It is to be noted with very
high confidence (IPCC, 2021) that the CMIP6 model ensemble reproduces
the observed historical global surface temperature trend and variability
with biases small enough to support detection and attribution of
human-induced warming (Eyring, et al., 2021), and that CMIP6 also
includes an extensive set of idealized and single forcing experiments
for attribution (Eyring et al., 2016; Gillett et al., 2016), but with
the important caveat that numerical models, however complex, cannot be a
perfect representation of the real world, and their use requires
considering the limitations of each model simulation (see 1.5.4 in Chen
et al., 2021). The figure below highlights an earlier effort that used
the “what if” approach on a global scale, where the impacts of
anthropogenic forcings are isolated through the use of NCAR’s coupled
Earth System Model. Trajectories of past global mean temperatures have
been estimated using experiments that do not incorporate anthropogenic
forcing produce the trajectory shown with the blue line and the light
blue uncertainty bounds. The black line shows the observed global mean
temperatures. You can see that the experiments that do not include
anthropogenic forcings fail to reproduce the warming that has been
observed over the past half century. Experiments were also run that do
include anthropogenic forcings. This trajectory is shown with the red
line and pink uncertainty bounds. You can see that when anthropogenic
forcings are included, the global climate models do produce results that
very closely match the observed warming trends. This suggests that
anthropogenic factors have emerged as a significant contributor to
global warming.</p>

<p>A more recent approach in climate modeling for detection and attribution
is to run a “Large Ensemble” of historical (and future) simulations,
where each member of the ensemble is subject to natural+anthropogenic
external forcings, but starts from a slightly different initial
condition, which results in a different trajectory of internal
variability once the memory of the initial state is lost. One can
estimate the forced component from the ensemble-average at any point in
time, since the internal component is randomly phased across the
different members of the ensemble. The figure below (Deser et al., 2020)
illustrates how the random phasing of internal variability of 60-year
trends over North America can obscure the forced trend at any given
location. Note the regional differences in the spatial patterns of the
trends over this time period (comparing the coldest and warmest ensemble
members for the same model on the bottom row); and by extension, how
much greater the natural variability is at these smaller spatial scales.
Such Large Ensembles, then, provide context for interpreting observed
trends. In this context, the actual observed trajectory can be
considered as one realization of many possible alternative worlds that
experienced different weather. This can also be demonstrated by the
construction of ‘observation-based large ensembles’, which are alternate
possible realizations of historical observations that retain the
statistical properties of observed regional weather (e.g., McKinnon and
Deser, 2018; Chen, et al., 2021). Referring back to the concept of
signal-to-noise and to the second panel of the figure, the ratio of the
mean shift from zero of the distributions (forced signal) compared to
(some metric of) their spread (internal variability “noise”) provides a
degree of the emergence in the anthropogenically-forced North America
heating trend.</p>

<p>Generally, attribution methods are grouped into two categories:
<em>Attribution of observed climate change to anthropogenic forcing</em> and
<em>Attribution of weather and climate events to anthropogenic forcing</em>, as
will the discussion that follows. Because the focus of this primer is on
climate change impacts on North America water studies, the focus in what
follows will be on regional approaches to this topic, referencing
Doblas-Reyes, et al. (2021) for the discussion of <em>Attribution of
observed climate change to anthropogenic forcing</em>, referencing
Seneviratne et al. (2021) for <em>Attribution of weather and climate events
to anthropogenic forcing</em>, and we refer the reader to Eyring et al.
(2021) for a discussion of the methods used for global-scale studies.</p>
<p><em>Attribution Methods: Attribution of observed climate change to
anthropogenic forcing –</em> Here, regional-scale attribution is the process
of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors (or
drivers) to regional climate change. Specific regional conditions and
responses may simplify or complicate attribution on those scales. In
general, regional climate variations are larger than the global mean
climate, adding additional uncertainty to attribution. In contrast with
global-scale attribution methods where internal variability might be
considered as a noise problem, the preliminary detection step is not
always required to perform regional-scale attribution since causal
factors of regional climate change may also include internal modes of
variability in addition to external natural and anthropogenic forcing.
Other complicating factors include an increased similarity among the
responses to different external forcings leading to a more difficult
discrimination of their effects, the importance at regional scale of
some omitted forcings in global model simulations, and model biases
related to the representation of small-scale phenomena (Zhai et al.,
2018). These statistical limitations may be reduced by <em>process-based
(or regional-scale) attribution</em>, focusing on the physical processes
known to influence the response to external forcing and internal
variability. We provide a summary of these attribution methodologies in
what follows, after first noting that these methodologies rely upon the
availability of high-quality observational datasets as well as
multi-model simulations of the historical period constrained by
different external forcing combinations, including single-forcing
experiments and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs).</p>
<p>Standard approaches include <em>optimal fingerprinting</em> methods that are
based on multivariate linear regression and assume that the observed
change consists of a linear combination of externally forced signals
plus internal variability. The main goal is to determine the extent to
which observed climate changes can be attributed to specific external
forcings. The regressors are the expected space–time response patterns
to different climate forcings (fingerprints), and the residuals
represent internal variability. Steps in <em>optimal fingerprinting</em>
include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Model Simulation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Control Runs: These simulations run climate models with no
external forcings, representing natural variability.</p></li>
<li><p>Forced Runs: These simulations include different external forcings
(e.g., greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar radiation).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fingerprint Identification:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pattern Recognition: Using climate models, scientists identify the
spatial and temporal patterns of climate response (fingerprints)
to each type of forcing.</p></li>
<li><p>Signal Estimation: The patterns represent the expected climate
response to specific forcings.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Statistical Analysis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linear Regression: The observed climate data is expressed as a
linear combination of the fingerprints plus a residual term
representing natural variability.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimation: The coefficients in the regression indicate the
strength of each forcing’s contribution to the observed changes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Optimal Filtering:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Noise Reduction: Statistical techniques are used to filter out the
noise (natural variability) from the signal (forced response).</p></li>
<li><p>Weighting: Optimal weighting is applied to maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio, enhancing the detection of the
fingerprints.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regional studies that have used this approach to detect multi-decadal
precipitation changes due to anthropogenic forcing for several regions
include: Ma et al., 2017; Song et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017; Tian et
al., 2018; Delworth and Zeng (2014); and Dey et al., 2019a, b.</p>
<p><em>Other Spatiotemporal Statistical Methods –</em> From Doblas-Reyes et al.
(2021), The primary objective of any attribution method is to optimally
separate the influences of external forcing and internal variability on
a global or regional climate record. In a multi-model ensemble context,
the estimation of the externally-forced climate response has been
typically performed by ensemble averaging of linear trends or regional
domain spatial average, thus not taking into account the available and
complete space and time covariance information. Methods using
spatiotemporal information to improve the separation between external
and internal drivers in multiple or single historical climate
realizations performed by a given global model include pattern filtering
methods such as signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal
functions (Ting et al., 2009); dynamical adjustment to extract the
response to external forcing in an observed or simulated single
realization (Smoliak et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2016; Sippel et al.,
2019); time scale separation methods (DelSole et al., 2011; Wills et
al., 2018, 2020); and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method
(Wu and Huang, 2009; Wilcox et al., 2013; Ji et al., 2014; Qian and
Zhou, 2014), which decomposes data, such as time series of historical
temperature and precipitation, into independent oscillatory modes of
decreasing frequency..</p>
<p><em>Attribution Methods: Attribution of weather and climate events to
anthropogenic forcing –</em> Here with reference to Hope et al. (2021) and
Seneviratne, et al. (2021), we discuss methods to attribute the change
in likelihood or characteristics of weather or climate events or classes
of events to underlying drivers, where typically, historical changes,
simulated under observed forcings, are compared to a counterfactual
climate simulated in the absence of anthropogenic forcing.</p>
<p>The outcome of event attribution is dependent on the definition of the
event (Leach et al., 2020), as well as the framing (Otto et al., 2016;
Christidis et al., 2018; Jézéquel et al., 2018) and uncertainties in
observations and modeling. Attribution statements are also dependent on
the spatial (Uhe et al., 2016; Cattiaux and Ribes, 2018;
Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019) and temporal (Harrington, 2017; Leach et
al., 2020) extent of event definitions, as events of different scales
involve different processes (Zhang et al., 2020) and large-scale
averages generally yield higher attributable changes in magnitude or
probability due to the smoothing out of noise. In general, confidence in
attribution statements for large-scale heat and lengthy extreme
precipitation events have higher confidence than shorter and more
localized events, such as extreme storms, an aspect also relevant for
determining the emergence of signals in extremes or the confidence in
projections (see also the tables of confidence in extremes for North
America in the next section).</p>
<p>Trend detection using optimal fingerprinting methods is a
well-established field. However, there are specific challenges when
applying optimal fingerprinting to the detection and attribution of
trends in extremes and on regional scales where the lower signal-
to-noise ratio is a challenge.</p>
<p>Apart from the detection and attribution of trends in extremes, new
approaches have been developed to answer the question of whether, and to
what extent, external drivers have altered the probability and intensity
of an individual extreme event (NASEM, 2016). A commonly used approach –
often called the risk-based approach in the literature, and referred to
here as the ‘probability-based approach’ – produces statements such as
‘anthropogenic climate change made this event type twice as likely’ or
‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 15% more intense’. This is
done by estimating probability distributions of the index characterizing
the event in today’s climate, as well as in a counterfactual climate,
and either comparing intensities for a given occurrence probability
(e.g., 1-in-100-year event) or probabilities for a given magnitude.
There are a number of different analytical methods encompassed in the
probability-based approach, building on observations and statistical
analyses (e.g., van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), optimal fingerprint
methods (Sun et al., 2014), regional climate and weather forecast models
(e.g., Schaller et al., 2016), global climate models (GCMs) (e.g., Lewis
and Karoly, 2013), and large ensembles of atmosphere-only GCMs (e.g.,
Lott et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Another approach examines facets of the weather and thermodynamic status
of an event through process-based attribution (Hauser et al., 2016;
Shepherd et al., 2018; Grose et al., 2018). Using these techniques,
attributable human influence has been found for heavy precipitation, and
certain types of droughts and tropical cyclones (e.g., Herring et al.,
2021).</p>

<p>The need for understanding the influence of climate change on the U.S.
water sector, its impacts, and need for informed decision-making across
the U.S. is highlighted in The Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5;
<a class="reference external" href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/">https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/</a>; see Chapter 2 for more in-depth
discussion) produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, with
the following key message, “The effects of human-caused climate change
are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United
States.” In addition, the NCA5 states that, “Changes in multiple aspects
of climate are apparent in every U.S. region … warming is apparent in
every region … average annual precipitation is increasing in most
regions, except in the Northwest, Southwest, and Hawai‘i, where
precipitation has decreased … heavy precipitation events are increasing
everywhere except Hawai‘i and the US Caribbean” (see NCA5 for further
information on how CC affects the U.S.’s physical Earth systems, current
and future risks, and what can be done to reduce those risks, in each of
the 10 NCA5-defined regions.</p>

<p id="section-2"><span id="section-1"></span><em>Precipitation Variability and Trends –</em> Unlike temperature, it is much
more difficult to detect a steady global trend in precipitation,
although trends toward wetter or drier conditions exist in certain
regions. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor. This can lead to
longer precipitation-free periods, but also more intense precipitation
when it does rain or snow.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="drafts/media/ch3_2/image32.png"><img alt="image22" src="drafts/media/ch3_2/image32.png" style="width: 6.5in; height: 5.86111in;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in the

from Karl et al. 2009).</em></p>
<p>Observations in the United States from 1958-2012 show that the amount of
precipitation falling in the heaviest 1% of daily events is increasing
in all states except Hawaii. The Northeast and upper Midwest have the
most notable increase in intense precipitation. The interrelationships
between precipitation and other climate variables are important to
hydrology. Temperature affects the hydrological cycle due to its
influence on evapotranspiration, water temperature, precipitation phase,
and melting, among other things.</p>

<p>Historic observations in the southwestern United States show multi-year
periods of both positive and negative annual precipitation anomalies
rather than a long-term trend in precipitation amount. Because the
warmer temperatures of recent decades can contribute to greater
evapotranspiration, the negative precipitation anomalies may result in
more severe drought compared to similar negative precipitation anomalies
of the early 20th century.</p>
<p><em>Trends in Extremes –</em> Observation-based studies show that natural
variability in temperature continues on the background of overall
warming. Precipitation trends show a tendency for more extremes, both
wet and dry, on a global scale, with some regional trends toward either
wetter or drier overall.</p>
<p>Typically, water research, resources planning, operations, and
management already consider natural climate variability. As we move into
the future, natural climate variability will continue, but it will be
superimposed on a trend caused by climate change. As the “background”
climate warms the global mean, the extremes associated with natural
variability may reach magnitudes rarely or never before seen in the
observed record.</p>
<p><em>Regional Information on Extremes –</em> The table below are taken from IPCC
AR6 (Seneviratne et al., 2021) and provides summary regional assessments
for hot extremes (HOT EXT.), heavy precipitation (HEAVY PRECIP.),
agriculture and ecological droughts (AGR./ECOL. DROUGHT), and
hydrological droughts (HYDR. DROUGHT). It shows the direction of change
and level of confidence in the observed trends (column OBS.), human
contribution to observed trends (ATTR.), and projected changes at 1.5°C,
2°C and 4°C of global warming for each AR6 region. Projections are shown
for two different baseline periods: 1850–1900 (pre-industrial) and
1995–2014 (modern or recent past) (see Seneviratne et al., 2021 Section
1.4.1 for more details). Direction of change is represented by an upward
arrow (increase) and a downward arrow (decrease). Level of confidence is
reported for LOW: low, MED.: medium, HIGH: high; levels of likelihood
(only in cases of high confidence) include: L: likely , VL: very likely
, EL: extremely likely , VC: virtual certain. Dark orange shading
highlights high confidence (also including likely , very likely ,
extremely likely and virtually certain changes) increases in hot
temperature extremes, agricultural and ecological drought, or
hydrological droughts. Yellow indicates medium confidence increases in
these extremes, and blue shadings indicate decreases in these extremes.
High confidence increases in heavy precipitation are highlighted in dark
blue, while medium confidence increases are highlighted in light blue.
No assessment for changes in drought with respect to the 1995–2014
